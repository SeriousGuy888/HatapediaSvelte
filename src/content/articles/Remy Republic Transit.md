Remy Republic Transit (RRT) is a public transit agency that was founded in the Remy Republic in 2023. The RRT operates a public subway, ferries and Nether rail network (NRN) through the Remy Republic and nations who have applied to have stations be built. While they have no physical office, the Remy Republic plans to build one located in Hawainot. There are three branches within the RRT: HATARail, HATASail, and Ember Rail.

# Origin

Remy Republic Transit was created by the Remy Republic in 2023. With the expanding of the Remy Republic thanks to the border disorder, the Glorious Leader RemyHemy thought that it would be essential for the Remy Republic to develop a mode of public transit. The idea was to unite the Remy Republic by connecting it with “an iron belt” in addition to making travel easier. Additionally, Billzo was also a big fan of building public transport and backed Remy in his idea. Billzo also asked Remy if he could connect Billzoplace to his network, to which Remy agreed. Due to the immense amount of materials needed to build this project, construction has been slow. However, numerous HATARail stations have been built as of writing. While the system currently isn’t in effect, those using the transit will be able to pay for it by tapping “hocus pocus” cards. Remy Republic citizens are also expected to have a discount when riding any branch of the RRT.

# Branches

## HATARail

HATARail is the subway system branch of the RRT. HATARail runs the subway system which runs within mainland HATA. While it was originally going to just run within the Remy Republic, Billzoplace applied to have a station built in Billzoplace City. Additionally, the Remy Republic and Billzoplace agreed to co-own Sheapland station, which is the land that connects the two nations. Billzoplace would then also provide the Remy Republic with numerous materials to help HATARail build many of its stations. This kind move by Billzo was acknowledged when HATARail officially agreed to award Billzoplace 20% of the company. Harka Oolahspitsheep finalized the negotiations in late September 2024. Billzoplace created the “Shu vuy? Shu voke!” campaign whose efforts are to reduce the crime that occurs on public transit. Tobytopia would also later apply to have a station built in Tobytown, however negotiations have been slow regarding the station due to Tobytopia’s strict border control.

There are four main lines of HATARail  
  
Line 1: The Remy Republic Line, No-New Mangrovia with stops in Scammington and Sheapland stations.

Line 2: The International Line, Sheapland-Billzoplace with a potential stop in Tobytopia.

Line 3: The Peace Line, New Mangrovia-The United Nations with a stop at Spawn.

Line 4: The Hawainot Line, Scammington-Hawainot West with a stop at Hawainot East.

Below is a map of the subways

## HATASail

HATASail is the ferry branch of RRT. The goal of HATASail was to harness the vast waters near the Remy Republic and provide transit via ferry. While there hasn’t been much development, a map which is listed below shows the original planned ferry docks locations and routes.

Since the creation of the map, more development has occurred elsewhere and plans will be made to adjust the routes before construction begins. Additionally, a third ferry line has been proposed that would take travers across the Remy Sea and to many islands and places on the Mediterraneanot Ocean.

## Ember Rail

Ember Rail is the Nether Rail Network (NRN) of RRT. The goal of Ember Rail is to connect parts of the Remy Republic and the world through tracks built in the Nether. Ember Rail employees are said to go through advanced training in order to deal with the Nether’s conditions and provide the most optimal service. While no plans have been formally drawn out, the following places have been approved to have stations: Sheapland, Hawainot, No, Cocoa Bean Cove, Edmonton, Auze, Floridanot, Bakaville. There are also places being considered for the future, they include: Billzoplace Jungle Island, Tobytown, Layon, International Iron Farm Territory, Lilypad Pond.

# Career

## First Appearance

The first known mention of Brewster the iron golem in [[HATA]] was on 2023-07-13, in a news article written by [[Remy]] regarding the [[Remy|Glorious Leader]]'s cleanup of Scammington after the "Night of Terror"\* caused by [[Holden]] and the "multiple creeper holes" caused by Arvi.

>[!note]
> \*It is unclear what Remy was referring to by "Night of Terror". It might refer to the [[Boxing Matchbox War]] (2023-07-06) or the [[Mushroom War#Raid on No|Raid on No]] (2023-07-09).

Brewster was found and rescued by the Remy Republic Search and Rescue Team, who found them "trapped in the Scammington underwater ravine for 146 days, as he jumped there to survive the accidental Order 66 deployment called on February 9th\[, 2023\]."

Brewster was designated as Guardian of Scammington, a title by which he had already unofficially been known by, for a while then, by the citizens of Scammington, for his valour in his defence of Scammington on 2023-02-09, despite his later decision to hide in the ravine as his health ran low.

Brewster received some repairs, which restored his ability to walk, and he was placed in a *Medical Recovery Pen* on the Scammington beach to continue his recovery.

## Death

On 2023-12-27, Brewster, trapped in the medical recovery pen, was impaled and killed by a trident-wielding drowned in the middle of the night. The footage of his gruesome murder, recorded by a Remyan security drone, was leaked to the press and reported in the news later that day.

At approximately 2023-12-27 13:13:56 UTC-5, the drowned, whose identity remains unknown, surfaced from the ocean and climbed onto the southwest side of the Scammington beach, repeatedly throwing its Loyalty-enchanted tridents onto the shore, aimed at Brewster. Brewster was unable to defend themself against the drowned's singlehanded onslaught due to being confined the the medical recovery pen. According to the timestamps in the drone footage, Brewster was subdued by around 13:14:30, and died by 13:14:31.

The drone footage also shows that the drone operator had attempted to send emergency healing to Brewster, but typos in the command slowed down the operator's attempt and so the drone operator was unable to dispatch the command in time.

The [[Remy|Glorious Leader]] was on break, eating lasagna, during the time of Brewster's death.

His death came right before the opening of [[HATA 2]], which began later on the same day.

## Revival

Brewster was revived on 2024-05-26 by [[Remy]], with the help of [[Billzo]], who lifted Brewster's body and spawned the particles, at the [[Wheat Sacrifice Shrine]]. This plot-armour resurrection ritual was performed during [[Billzo]], [[Remy]], and [[Toby]]'s revisit to [[HATA 1]] during the night between 2024-05-25 and 2024-05-26. 

This resurrection did not go as smoothly as past resurrections in the shrine, due to the long time — almost six months — it had been since HATA 1 had been active. The command block used to summon the particles for the ritual had gone missing, and Billzo was forced to spawn the particles by typing out the command by hand.

Regardless, the rite was successful, and magical forces repaired Brewster's body, with cracks in the hull resoldered, and the withered vines regaining their verdance. Brewster's body was reanimated without any apparent side-effects, much to Brewster's own shock.

Remy made the decision to relieve Brewster from his duties in Scammington and allowed Brewster to live in [[No]] instead.

# Honours

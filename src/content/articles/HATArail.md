1. The **Remy Republic Line**: [[No]] to [[New Mangrovia]], via [[Scammington]] and [[Sheapland]]
2. The **International Line**: [[Sheapland]] to [[Tobytown|Tobytopia]], via [[Billzoplace]]

# History

## Early Days

Though originally planned to operate exclusively within the [[Remy Republic]], [[Billzoplace]] applied to have a station built in Billzoplace City. Additionally, the Remy Republic and Billzoplace agreed to build Sheapland Station, midway between the station in Billzoplace and the rest of the network. As part of the deal, Billzoplace accordingly agreed to provide the Remy Republic with numerous materials to help HATArail build many of its stations. This kind geesture by Billzo was acknowledged when HATArail officially agreed to award Billzoplace 20% of the company. [[Harka Oolahspitsheep]] finalized the negotiations in late September 2024.

## "Thu vyu? Shu voke!" Campaign

Billzoplace created the "Thu vyu? Shu voke!" campaign whose efforts aim to reduce crime in the public transit network.

## The Line to Tobytown

[[Tobytopia]] would later also apply to be connected to the subway network and have a station built in [[Tobytown]], but negotiations regarding the details of the station have been slow due to Tobytopiaâ€™s strict border control. [[Toby]] has asserted that Tobytopia's cautious approach to becoming part of the network is partially because of fears of Remyan criminals entering Tobytopia via the subway.

A **big damage missile** (stylised in all lowercase), also capitalised as **Big Damage Missile**, sometimes colloquially referred to as a **nuke**, a **missile**, or a **rocket**, is a specific model of firework rocket whose explosion is known to pose major health risks to those in the vicinity.

# Item Data

# History

## Origin

Big damage missiles were not originally intended to be accessible for regular players. [[Billzo]] was testing firework rockets on the server and had dropped them in a place outside of the worldborder at the time, intending for them to despawn; however, as the chunks remained unloaded, the stack of big damage missiles did not despawn.

When [[Toby]] eventually arrived on the beach where the stack of rockets were dropped — the beach on the island that eventually became the [[Tobytopian Southern Territories]] — he discovered the stack of discarded rockets.

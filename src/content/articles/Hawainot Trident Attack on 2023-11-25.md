# Recount

In the middle of the night, a drowned bearing a trident, surfaced from the ocean and approached the beach of [[Equalsosceles Island]]. All the villagers were asleep in their beds, entirely unaware of what was about to happen.

The drowned started throwing tridents into the commune, striking and killing a resident villager, [[Ethan Class]]. Several other villagers were also injured but not killed.

An iron golem was able to neutralise perpetrator before any further damage could take place.

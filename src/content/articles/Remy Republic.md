# Provinces and Territories

The Remy Republic is subdivided into provinces and territories.

![[Provinces and Territories of the Remy Republic 2023-02-15.png]]

## Provinces

Provinces in the Remy Republic are full parts of the country, and they are included and represented in the Duck Nest, the upper house of the Remyan legislature.

The provinces of the Remy Republic are as follows:
- [[Forgsville]]
- [[Scammington]]
- [[Hawainot]]
- [[No]]
- [[New Mangrovia]] (formerly Remyan Mangovia)

## Territories

Territories are non-core parts of the Remy Republic. They are not colonies, per se, on account of not being called that, but they do not receive representation in the Duck Nest.

The territories of the Remy Republic are as follows:
- [[Cocoa Bean Cove]]
- [[Edmonton]] (formerly Cave Place)
- [[Floridanot]]
- [[Auze]]

### Former Territories

[[Layon#Archie Bridge|Archie Bridge]] was briefly proclaimed to be a territory of the Remy Republic during the [[Mushroom War]] under the name of the *Territory of Archie*.

# Government

The Remy Republic government is organised as a federal parliamentary republic.
Each province sends elected representatives to the Remyan parliament.

The Parliament of the Remy Republic is a bicameral legislature, with an upper house ‚Äî the *Duck Nest* ‚Äî and a lower house ‚Äî the *Villager Council*.

## Election

*See also: [[Election Night Shooting]]*

![[First_Parliament_of_the_Remy_Republic.png|Result of the election: Remy gets another term as Glorious Leader, SBP wins both houses of parliament]]
The election for the Villager Council occurred and concluded on 2023-02-16.

The election for the Duck Nest occurred on 2023-02-16, although a second vote for the Duck Nest continued until 21:00 on the following day, 2023-02-17.

### Duck Nest

The following are the candidates who ran in the first Remy Republic election for seats in the Duck Nest. The Slime Ball Party was able to achieve a full sweep of a victory in the election, at least in the Duck Nest.

|                   |        Slime Ball Party (SBP)         | Magma Cream Party (MCP) | Bloc Nobecois (BNQ) |
| -----------------:|:-------------------------------------:|:-----------------------:|:-------------------:|
|    **Forgsville** |            [[Remyforg]] üèÜ            |     Mike MacWebster     |                     |
|   **Scammington** |           Doug Shimadome üèÜ           | [[William Scamsworth]]  |                     |
|            **No** |          Huck Finnisiter üèÜ           |      Toby Tontory       |   Gerry Flexagon    |
|      **Hawainot** | Glorious Leader [[Remy\|RemyHemy]] üèÜ |        Jose III         |                     |
| **New Mangrovia** |           John Nevilory üèÜ            |         Jose II         |                     |

It is worth noting that the vote was originally undecided, with the vote counts of Forgsville, New Mangrovia, and Hawainot all being tied at exactly 8 votes for the SBP and MCP each. As a result, a second vote was called a day later, and as [[Toby]] and [[Arvi]] were not able to participate in this vote<sup>[verification needed]</sup>, the SBP was able to take the victory.

### Villager Council

The Slime Ball Party also won a majority in the Villager Council, although it was not a full sweep, unlike the Duck Nest. The final vote **percentages** for the Villager Council were as follows:

| Province/Territory    | SBP    | MCP   | BNQ   | Ind   | 
|:--------------------- |:------ |:----- |:----- |:----- |
| Hawainot              | 95 üèÜ  | 5     |       |       |
| Forgsville            | 75 üèÜ  | 25    |       |       |
| No                    | 25     | 24    | 51 üèÜ |       |

# History

## The Great Mangrove War

Please see: [[Great Mangrove War]]

## The Border Disorder

> Mr Tobachov, tear down that wall!

As the Glorious Leader, Remy, spoke these immortal words, the HATA worldborder
trembled in fear and retreated outwards.

### Western Hawainot Offensive

```youtube

```

The Remy Republic initiated a military operation led by General [[Fletcher Quadratic]] and swiftly invaded the western islands of the Hawainot Archipelago. Remy was then able to collect his jungle wood and cocoa beans so that he can finally begin producing his pogstries.

The military operation unfortunately was in fact very rushed in its planning and the logistics were not well prepared for. The food shipments did not arrive and Remy was forced to live off the land for the duration of the operation.

![[western_hawainot_offensive.png|Map of the Remyan advance into Western Hawainot]]

#### Acquisition of Southern No

After planting his flag in Western Hawainot and acquiring his so coveted cocoa beans, Remy also claimed Southern No. This is an area of land that was originally labelled as being part of No on the first worldmap released, but tragically, in reality, lay outside the confines of the 1000 block worldborder.

[[Toby|Toby from Tobytopia]] had threatened to claim Southern No before Remy could during the days leading up to the Border Disorder, but these threats did not come to fruition.

#### Jungle Island Incident

Remy had a dispute with Tobytopia over an island of sparse jungle to the west of Hawainot. Remy had previously intended to claim this island, but had forgotten to do so in the commotion of the Border Disorder. This island had a waterfall, and Remy had intended to turn the island into a top tier resort due to its very unique and beautiful terrain.

Unfortunately for the Glorious Leader, Toby from Tobytopia found the island and claimed it before Remy could do so. Toby planted the Tobytopian banner upon the northern side of the island, cementing his claim before Remy could get there with his own banners.

Remy attempted an amphibious assault on the island, arriving in his oak boat. Unfortunately, the Remyan military forces under General [[Fletcher Quadratic]] were tied down doing paperwork after the Western Hawainot offensive. This meant that the Remyan invasion force was extremely understaffed, with only the Glorious Leader himself participating in the invasion.

The invasion was repulsed by the defending Tobytopian forces. The Glorious Leader then made a glorious retreat back to Hawainot after his glorious defeat on the glorious jungle island.

![[jungle_island_incident.png|Map of disputed jungle island]]

#### Claiming of the Jungle Mainland

After the glorious defeat on the jungle island, and on the suggestion of Toby, Remy rowed his boat westward again, and claimed the coastline of the large landmass further to the west of the jungle island. This landmass also had a large area of sparse jungle on it.

## Night of Mischief

### Duck Heist

On 2023-04-09, [[Holden]] attempted to kidnap a group of [[Scammington|Scammingtonian]] ducks, including [[William Scamsworth]]. The [[Remy|Glorious Leader]], after learning of this, intervened and apprehended Holden demanding that he complete his parole, which was to remove the mangrove trees from No, as per the terms set at the end of the [[Great Mangrove War]].

When confronting Holden, the Glorious Leader was seen assaulting Holden, the perpetrator of the ducksnatching case, when he thought nobody was watching. Holden repeatedly stated that he was not resisting, but the Glorious Leader continued to punch him, later killing him as well.

![[Glorious Leader performs police brutality.png]]

> [[Holden]]:
> 
> I'm not resisting! I'm not resisting!

> [[Remy]]:
> 
> You don't need to file a _lawsuit_.
> 
> You already owe me a date.

Holden, at some point, managed to evade capture by Remyan authorities and twice escaped on escape vehicles driven by [[Arvi]] and [[Toby]], who were later caught stealing more ducks from the animal pens in [[No]].

### Aftermath

The Remyan government claimed that the Night of Mischief, as it was later dubbed, caused "significant damage to public property" and "disrupted the peace of the community". The government subsequently declared a state of emergency, closing several areas for repairs and announcing plans to punish Arvi and Toby for their involvement in the night.

During an emergency meeting of the Duck Nest, the Villager Council, and Remyan military officials, the need for enhanced security measures was discussed. Top scientist of the Remy Republic, [[Leonard Pentagon]], proposed funding research into strength syrup for clones and building a new laboratory in a new piece of territory to be known as [[Blocksburg]], but MCP members disagreed on how to allocate funding.

The alliance between Toby's [[Tobytopia]], [[Holden's Regime]], and Arvi's [[Neville]] was given the name "the Allies of [Tromos](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%84%CF%81%CF%8C%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%82)" by the Remyan government. The Glorious Leader then declaring the creation of the Allies of [Asphaleia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B1%CF%83%CF%86%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%B1), which was touted as a counter to the Allies of Tromos. This growing polarisation between factions in the region raised concerns about future conflicts and their potential impact on the stability of the area.

### Speech Following the Night of Mischief

The Glorious Leader made the following speech on 2023-04-10 regarding the events of the previous night.

> [!cite] Citizens of the Remy Republic,
> An iron curtain has fallen upon us all. We have been misled by those we were led to trust. We have been beaten and bruised by those we thought were close to our hearts. We have been insulted by those who focus on harassing others rather than improving themselves. In short, we have been blindsided and betrayed.
> 
> As the leader of the Remy Republic, I shall not let these recent attacks go unnoticed. The Night of Mischief was the unfortunate warning the Remy Republic needed to wake up and better prepare ourselves. I promise you that we will build back better and stronger, and we will vanquish those who try to go against us.
> 
> This new gang of scallywags, the Allies of Tromos, will fall and get what they have been waiting for. Over the next few days, our government will band together and initiate a battle plan to combat the Tromos, and for the protection of the Remy Republic, the government will declare a state of emergency.
> 
> The Remyan military will be commanded to patrol and keep the Remy Republic safe. As a final warning, those who betray the family that is the Remy Republic during the state of emergency shall be punished in Remyan court. That is all I have to say. Thank you, and goodnight.

## Holden's Coup Attempt

*Main article: [[Boxing Matchbox War]]*

After a boxing match with [[Holden]] ended in chaos and Remy was murdered by [[Anna]] over a copyright dispute regarding the drip applied to his armour, Holden, with some help from Anna, was nearly able to seize control of the Remy Republic.

## Mushroom War

*Main article: [[Mushroom War]]*

After a [[Neville|Nevillian]] invasion of [[Auze]], the Remy Republic retalliated by occupying [[Layon#Archie Bridge|Archie Bridge]]. The conflict then further escalated, with [[Arvi]], [[Anna]], and [[Holden]] arriving in [[No]] and accidentally triggering a pillager raid.

# Sports

The Remy Republic has sports I think.

## Bobble League

The national team of the Remy Republic is the [[Flagrant Fowls]].

## Football

The Remy Republic reportedly plans to build a stadium in Scammington for "the good type" of football.

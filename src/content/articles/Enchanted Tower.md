The **Enchanted Tower** was a tower built by [[Adam]] upon the meadowed area with cherry groves and grassy plains to the southeast of the Trafficking Ocean, where he and a group of other people, mainly — [[Arvi]] and [[Anna]] — resettled after leaving their temporary base near spawn.

During the announcement that Adam made when the tower was complete, he described the purpose of the tower as being for "rituals happening soon", though not elaborating on the nature or purpose of said rituals. No rituals are known to have actually been held at the tower during its brief existence.

# Inception

The United Nations was an idea conceived by [[Remy]], the Glorious Leader of the [[Remy Republic|Remy Republic]], apparently based on something similar from a so-called "dream world" called """""""CheezSurvNations""""""".

Remy came up with this idea after Arvi tried to sell him some real estate that [[Arvi]] had built near spawn.

# Headquarters

The United Nations is headquartered to the northeast of Spawn, in the oak and cobblestone building built by architect Arvi.

After buying the building from Arvi for the price of a building permit for a bar in [[Scammington]], Remy renovated the interior of the building to be fit to host the United Nations.

Remy added chairs and a table, as well as ladders to get up and down.

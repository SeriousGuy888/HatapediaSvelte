# History

Though already existing as a side character before this, Birch Nuke was first mentioned by name on-screen on 2023-03-16.

## Acceptance to Scammington

On 2023-03-25, [[Billzo]] noticed that Birch Nuke, who then lived in [[Billzoplace]], was offering a trade of one *Bane of Arthropods V* enchanted book for the extortionate price of sixty-four emeralds. Upon hearing of Birch Nuke's scamming talent, the [[Remy Republic]] soon extended an offer to Birch Nuke for him to come live in [[Scammington]], which he accepted. [[Remy]] was then sent to collect Birch Nuke.

## Surviving the Scammington Bar Arson

Birch Nuke was seen later on 2023-03-25 visiting the [[Scammington Bar]] for the first time, and, according to Scammington locals, he soon became a regular face at the bar, where he eventually met [[William Scamsworth]]. The two were reportedly close friends by 2023-04-02.

William Scamsworth and Birch Nuke were both present at the Scammington Bar when it was [[Scammington Bar#Destruction|burned down]] by [[Arvi]] on 2023-04-13, but both of them luckily survived.

## First Death by Drowned

On 2023-06-08, Birch Nuke was killed in Scammington, having been zombified by a drowned. Nuke then burned in the blazing sunshine of that hot day on Scammington Beach, dropping some rotten flesh and three cuts of villagermeat. [[Billzo]] notified Birch Nuke's body in a makeshift coffin and notified [[Remy]].

Remy then brought Birch Nuke's remains to the [[Wheat Sacrifice Shrine]] in [[No]] and set up a campfire to perform a revival séance, successfully bringing Birch Nuke back to life. Birch Nuke was reportedly quite confused and disoriented upon his body's reanimation.

Birch Nuke also suffered some memory loss and no longer offered his prodigious trade of *Bane of Arthropods V* for sixty-four emeralds.

After this death and revival, Remy placed Birch Nuke in a "protection cage" in [[Forgsville]] right outside the front door of [[Remy's Home Sweet Home]], where Nuke would live for the next few months.

## Death in Forgsville Massacre

On 2025-04-05, Birch Nuke was killed by [[Adam]] in the [[Forgsville Massacre]] while he was stuck in his protection cage. He was revived by [[Remy]] the next day at the [[Wheat Sacrifice Shrine]] due to his plot armour.

## Becoming the First Bartender at the Cow Jumped over the Spoon

On 2025-06-28, Birch Nuke was hired to be the first bartender at [[The Cow Jumped over the Spoon]], and he also attended the grand opening of the bar as well.

## Second Death by Drowned

On 2025-07-19, Birch Nuke was killed by a drowned armed with a trident on the beach in front of the entrance to [[The Cow Jumped over the Spoon]]. Remy rushed to revive him again.

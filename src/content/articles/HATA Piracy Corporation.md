# History

## Establishment of the Commune

The HATA Piracy Corporation was, technically speaking, founded before the start of HATA 2, though it was not yet known as the HATA Piracy Corporation. This tale recounts the first days of the Corporation and the journey of its founding members on the first day of HATA 2.

### Formation of the Pact

On 2023-12-26, one day before the start of HATA 2, [[Billzo|Bill]] and [[Remy]] agreed to be part of the same group in HATA 2. Toby also joined this group later on.

### Seed Selection

On 2023-12-27, the first day of HATA 2, before the start of the server, [[Toby]] was still yet to select a world seed to use. After Billzo found an intriguing world seed, in which a large mushroom island was found to be located a couple of kilometers northeast of spawn, Toby agreed to use this as the seed for the server.

### The Journey

After the server officially opened, and everyone was online (Remy arrived late) and had gathered some basic supplies, Remy, Toby, and Billzo set off together from the shipwreck at spawn in a pair of wooden rowboats. They rowed northeast from spawn.

#### The First Rest

They reached a plains biome landmass, stopping there for a short while to gather wood, stone, coal, and food. This was also where Toby found some sheep, placing them into boats to be taken to the group's new home in their intended destination, making Toby the first person in the Corporation to have engaged in animal trafficking, something which came to be very important in Pirate culture.

Exactly which landmass it was that the three landed on is likely to be what later became the southeastern portion of the Bilge Rats' old base, due to its proximity to spawn, the amount of grass and sand matching up with contemporary accounts, and its proximity to the strait through which the group sailed through to leave the Bay of Spawn.

#### Sailing the Seas

After passing through the strait out of the Bay of Spawn, now on three boats because they were carrying two sheep, Remy expressed regret at having missed the opportunity to tame a parrot from the jungle by spawn, which would have been greatly beneficial to the pirate persona he was maintaining at the time. Bill had offered to turn back towards spawn so that Remy could visit the jungle, but Remy turned this down.

They frequently made stops in order to raid ocean ruins and ruined portals sighted below the boat, from which they gathered various pieces of early game gear and loot. The seas were serene and the sailing was smooth, although Remy’s inconsistent internet connection did pose some challenges for the group.

#### The Second Rest

The party later stopped on an empty grassy island, now known as [[Rest Stop Island]], some hundred meters to the west of the mushroom island. The island contained a single tree, which was cut down by Billzo to craft a smoker. Billzo replanted three saplings in place of the tree, but, due to the remoteness of the island, the saplings were hardly within any player's simulation distance and are still yet to grow into trees as of writing on 2024-03-29.

The purpose of this rest stop was to gather some food, chiefly <ruby>sea lettuce<rt>kelp</rt></ruby>, which was abundant in the ocean. They cooked the sea lettuce in the smokers, yielding <ruby>crispy sea lettuce<rt>dried kelp</rt></ruby>, enough to sustain Billzo and Remy for the remainder of the trip.

#### Toby's Departure

Toby eventually had to leave the game, leaving Remy and Bill to continue to the island alone with the two sheep in tow. As the two continued forth, the north tip of the island slowly manifested itself upon the horizon.

### The Landing

>"Land ho!"
>—Remy

“Land ho!” Remy exclaimed from the crow’s nest of his rowboat. They landed on the island, finding but mycelium and mushrooms — a blank canvas on which to build their pirate empire. A single grass block was present where they landed. Billzo broke some of the neighbouring mycelium blocks and replaced the dirt, hoping that the grass would spread.

The sheep were left in the boats along the shore where they had landed, as the <ruby>Glorious Plunderer<rt>Remy</rt></ruby> and the <ruby>God of News<rt>Billzo</rt></ruby> explored the island and set up camp. Remy placed down his jungle logs on the shore and planted the cocoa beans upon them, starting the first cocoa bean farm. Nearby, Billzo converted some of the mycelium on the shore into farmland, where he planted wheat seeds, thereby establishing the first wheat farm on the island.

They set up a provisional base further inland, containing a bed, a double chest, a crafting table, a furnace, and a smoker.

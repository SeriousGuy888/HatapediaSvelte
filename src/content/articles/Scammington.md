# History

## Order 66 Accident

The Glorious Leader accidentally called Order 66 in Scammington, which resulted in the death of almost the entirety of the Scammington villager population.<sup>[exact dates needed]</sup>

## Refugee Crisis of the Sandy Island Demolition

The large population of turtles in Scammington can be attributed to the refugee crisis<sup>[exact dates needed]</sup> caused by [[Billzo Shoom]] deciding one day to demolish a sandy island where a large number of turtles lived.

As a result, many of these turtles fled to the Remy Republic, specifically to Scammington, perhaps due to the familiarity of its climate and environment. The Glorious Leader, during this refugee crisis, issued a statement, saying that the Remy Republic would welcome these refugees with open arms.

The turtles' arrival also pushed out the few remaining villager residents in Scammington.

This mass migration has also had an impact on the culture of Scammington<sup>[more information needed]</sup>.

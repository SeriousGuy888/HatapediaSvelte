The **City of Torrento** is the capital city of the [[HATA Piracy Corporation]]. The city, located at around 1840, 72, -1500 in the [[HATA 2]] overworld, is located on the north side of the [[Untitled Mushroom Island]].

# Districts

Torrento is generally considered to have two distinct regions: the Captain's Quarter and Sporeborough. These two regions don't include all parts of the city; the two mentioned are just places with concentrated, distinct building styles.

## Captain's Quarter

The Captain's Quarter is a district in the northeast of Torrento. It was primarily built by [[Billzo]]. 

Some buildings in the Captain's Quarter include
- the Helm (the warehouse)
- the Captain Café
- Scallywag's Slumber
- the Barrrbershop

The name of the district is a reference to the French Quarter in New Orleans.

The rough area encompassed by the Captain's Quarter was formerly known as the Capital District. The name "Captain's Quarter" began to be used around the time of the construction of the Captain Café, Scallywag's Slumber, and the Barrrbershop.

## Sporeborough

Sporeborough is a district in the northwest of Torrento. It was primarily built by [[Toby]], although the concept of the district — a "mushroom district" with mushroom-themed houses — was originally conceived by [[Remy]].

Some buildings in Sporeborough include
- the Soggy Cave Mine entrance
- Toby's house
- Toby's office
- Toby's stables

The name of the district is a reference to Scarborough.

Before being given a name, Sporeborough was sometimes referred to as the Mushroom Town, Mushroom District, or Fungal District. The name "Sporeborough" began to be used at around the same time as the name of the Captain's Quarter. After the Captain's Quarter was given a name, [[Billzo|Bill]] asked Toby to come up with a name for the mushroom town. Together, they, as well as Remy, brainstormed some names for the area, eventually settling on "Sporeborough", although other names were considered, such as "Mushroom Metropolis", "Sporeston", "Redcaps"/"Browncaps", "Shroomy Settles", "Sporal City", and "Sporeburg"/"Sporesburg".

# History

## Settlement

The land on which Torrento is now built was first settled on the first day of [[HATA 2]]. This journey by [[Billzo|Bill]], [[Remy]], and [[Toby]] to settle the mushroom island is detailed in [[HATA Piracy Corporation#Establishment of the Commune]].

## Name

The name "Torrento" first started to be used to refer to the city during late August or early September of 2024. The name was coined by [[Billzo]] as a parody of Toronto, but modified to include the word "torrent" — a common method of sharing pirated files.

The Remy Republic's official estimate was 212 ducks murdered in the first killing.

[[Birch Nuke]], [[Miles Class]], [[Liam Forg Ashwin]], and [[Liam Staig Music]] were also killed by [[Adam]] on this day, though only Birch Nuke was actually in Forgsville at the time. They would each later be revived by [[Remy]] for plot armour purposes.

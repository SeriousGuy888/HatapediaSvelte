# Early Life

As a young duckling, Beetroot discovered his passion for sailing from reading about the epique naval battles in the history of the Remy Republic.

Growing up, Beetroot had aspired to join the Remyan Navy, but decided to switch careers and enter the Remyan merchant fleet after the Remy Republic government decided to reduce national defence funding.

# Career

## Cocoa Bean Delivery

During his early days in the Remyan merchant fleet, Beetroot was assigned to small-time delivery routes. He sailed the [[SS Saxophone]] and delivered cocoa beans from [[Hawainot]] and [[Cocoa Bean Cove]] to the rest of the [[Remy Republic]].

During this time, [[Grand Admiral Prawn]], head of the Remyan Navy once praised Beetroot, calling him one of the best captains he has ever seen.

## Shipping the Crazy Straw Grave

### Background

[[Liam Staig Music]], the Chairmain of the [[Committee for the Wheat Field of the Province of No]] had long tried to get the gravestone out of the way, out of No, so he could expand the wheat field onto the land it occupied.

Covered in bubblewrap and styrofoam as it was carried the way down to the beach the gravestone was lifted and fastened onto the ship with locally made woven wheat rope by a group of dock ducks, temporarily hired from nearby Forgsville for this important job.

### Embarkation

On 2023-10-29, Beak Beetroot set off from the southern beach in [[No]] on the [[RRMS Musician]] to ship the [[Crazy Straw Grave]] from No off to the [[Tobytopian First Empire Elites]], the shadowy, wealthy buyers who won the auction for the gravestone.

> Finally got that squared away. More room for wheat.
> —Liam Staig Music

The route to be sailed was filled with turns and bends through the [[Mediterraneanot Ocean]] towards a cherry grove near [[Neville]], with a round trip estimated to take fourteen days. This, in fact, turned out to be the wrong address, a result of Liam Staig Music's imprudence in his haste to get the gravestone shipped away.

Beetroot did not know this at the time, and set sail with the directions he was given.

### Stuck in the Layon River

By 2023-11-01, Beetroot had sailed all the way from No, south into the Mediterraneanot, and back north into the [[Layon River]]. He had navigated several hundred meters north along the Layon river but hit a roadblock as he approached the [[Layon|City of Layon]].

A bridge, constructed of soil and grass, was blocking the Layon River and built too low for the RRMS Musician and its cargo to pass under. This obstacle was notably not charted on the course that Beetroot was provided, and it caused him great frustration.

> I don't think I can move my boat _and_ the cargo across land all by myself. I mean, I could lift either _one_ of them on their own, but if I unloaded the cargo, I wouldn't be able to load it back on the ship on my own. I didn't bring a shovel to dig a canal either. I may have to turn back and find an alternate route.

When news of this broke, [[Liam Staig Music|Chairmain Music]] came under fire for providing Captain Beetroot with inaccurate directions.

### Reverse Course

After several days of searching for workarounds, Beetroot decided to turn back and take an alternate route that was transmitted to him by the Remyan government. It took a few weeks, but, by 2023-11-25, Beetroot had made his way all the way back to where he started and passed by it to the northwest, sailing by the [[Scammington Boxing Ring]].

# Career

## Castaway (unknown to 2023-01-26)

Fletcher Quadratic was a member of a group of villagers who fell off and swam away from the [[Limedye Oil Rig]]. His group swam southwards and ended up stranded on [[Equalsosceles Island]] in central eastern [[Hawainot]].

This party of approximately sixteen villagers then set up camp on the island, surviving off the land and writing "SOS" with their beds in hopes of being rescued.

## Leader of the Island Commune of Marooned and Stranded Villagers (2023-01-26 to present)

On 2023-01-26, the [[Remy|Glorious Leader]] paid a visit to the marooned villagers' camp on [[Equalsosceles Island]]. After he asked to speak to the leader of the villagers' party, it was Fletcher Quadratic who stepped forth and negotiated with the Glorious Leader.

After some discussion, Remy, gracious, benevolent, generous, and glorious as he is, agreed to offer asylum and refugee status to the stranded villagers, allowing them to stay in the Remy Republic. The villagers were reportedly "pogging extremely hard" in response to this encounter.

Fletcher Quadratic became extremely popular among his villager peers after negotiating this favourable agreement.

## General in the Remyan Army (2023-01-27 to present)

Fletcher Quadratic reportedly received great favour from the Glorious Leader himself.

In preparation for the [[Remy Republic#Western Hawainot Offensive|Western Hawainot Offensive]], the Glorious Leader promoted Quadratic to the rank of general in the Remyan army.

This was a controversial move among the other villagers in the Island Commune, considering that Quadratic had not even been in the military before his promotion directly to general. However, Quadratic was successful in proving his merit with his masterful management of the amphibious invasion of the [[Hawainot Channel Islands]] during the operation.

Fletcher Quadratic was celebrated among those he led for the successful invasion he directed. An impressively small total of zero casualties were incurred on either side before the islands were captured. This rivals even the operation led by the Glorious Leader himself — alone, which also sustained zero casualties.

His contributions were regarded as vital to the Remy Republic's acquisition of its first ever cocoa beans — an essential ingredient in the process for making pogstries.

Unfortunately, Quadratic turned out to not be very proficient at paperwork, on account of barely being literate. This was significant because he was forced to fill out several sheets of forms and information sheets in order to formalise the annexation of Western Hawainot, leading to him and his troops being unable to participate in the failed [[Remy Republic#Jungle Island Incident|invasion of the jungle island]], as the Glorious Leader was forced to attempt the invasion entirely alone.

During the [[Mushroom War]], Fletcher Quadratic, with Remy, drew up plans for [[Operation Yellow Brick Road]].

# History

## Founding

The City of Neville was first founded on `2023-04-07` by [[Arvi]] when he first created the city's wheat field. [[Remy]] at one point accused Arvi of having built his wheat field with wheat seeds stolen from [[No]]. Arvi denied this.

## Mushroom War

From `2023-07-08` to `2023-07-09`, Neville fought in the [[Mushroom War]] against the [[Remy Republic]]. The war did not change anything in the end, and Neville would end up signing the [[Pink and Purple Treaty|PP Treaty]] with Remy just a few days later.

## Establishment of the Capital

# Economy

The main industry of Neville is agriculture. Neville is best known for its large wheat field.

Neville has received some investment from the Remy Republic for its wheat field.

# Diplomacy

Neville maintains diplomatic and trade relations with the [[Remy Republic]]. These relations are defined by the [[Treaty of Neville]].

Neville maintains that it is free to pursue diplomatic relations with whichever nations it desires, including [[Tobytopia]].

## Alliance with the Remy Republic

On `2023-07-13` during a meeting with Remy at the [[United Nations]], [[Arvi]], as the Doomslayer Nine Thousand, officially proclaimed that Neville would now be known as the *Kingdom of Neville*. The meeting the discussion leading up to the signing of the [[Pink and Purple Treaty]] which constituted a formalisation of the alliance between the Kingdom of Neville and the [[Remy Republic]].

Residents of Neville, namely Arvi, have complained that it is just constantly raining in Neville.

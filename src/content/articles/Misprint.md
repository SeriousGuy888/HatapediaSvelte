"**Misprint**" is a term that refers to characters or [[The Voices|voices]] in [[HATA]] that come into being via the unnatural method of being summoned, usually at the [[Wheat Sacrifice Shrine]], from the underworld, back to the overworld, despite the character in question never having existed prior to being recalled from the realm of the dead.

# Cause of Misprints

Misprints are usually not summoned intentionally. Most commonly, the summoner of the séance intends to resurrect a character that was killed, but misremembers the name of the character they intend to resurrect. Under normal circumstances, the séance should simply fail to summon anybody, but in some cases, the séance will succeed regardless, delivering to the summoner a character other than the one they were attempting to summon.

# Famous Misprints

Some examples of well-known characters that are misprints include

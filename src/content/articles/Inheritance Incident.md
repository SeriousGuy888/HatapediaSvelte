# Chronicle

## Toby's Death

On 2023-06-29, [[Toby]] was climbing around the [[Billzoplace City Villager Residence 1|brick residential building]] in [[Billzoplace]] when he fell off a balcony, dying of fall damage on the first floor balcony, leading to his items to be splattered all over said balcony and down to [[Billzoplace City Main Street|the street below]].

## Jasper Inherits Toby's Items

[[Remy]] and [[Jasper]] happened to be passing by, and Remy, as executor of Toby's non-ficticious will, invited Jasper, as the heir, to collect his inheritance from Toby's fresh corpse. Jasper was eager to do so, running forward and collecting Toby's items. He climbed up to the balcony, donning and flaunting Toby's highly drippy (having armour trims applied) armour.

## Remy Shot Dead at Shakakowo Bridge

Toby, after hearing that Jasper had taken his items, quickly gathered a set of backup gear, including backup netherite armour, <ruby>ekto mode<rt>invisibility</rt></ruby> potions, and a <ruby>rocket launcher<rt>crossbow</rt></ruby> with [[big damage missile|big damage missiles]]. He intended to contest his own will and disinherit Jasper postmortem.

Toby found his way back to Billzoplace, where Remy and Jasper were hanging around by [[Billzo Shoom|Billzo]]'s house on the north side of the river. Toby, from the south side of the [[Shakakowo Bridge]], approached the pair, invisible and wearing armour at the same time, while menacingly brandishing his rocket launcher.

The [[Remy|Glorious Leader]] then charged forwards towards Toby, onto the bridge, intending to challenge the Ultimate Kaiser of Doom Three Thousand and protect his client. Jasper stayed back by the nether portal and drew his bow, firing at Toby. Remy survived at least one direct hit from one of Toby's big damage missiles, but in his attempt to flee after being hit, he was shot and killed by Toby on the south side of the river by the bridge.

## Toby Flees the Country

After successfully killing Remy, Toby ran to the Billzoplace City <ruby>Mailhouse<rt>Post Office</rt></ruby>, where he presumably intended to recover from the encounter and plan his next moves. However, the Ultimate Kaiser in the Mailhouse, while aiming his rocket launcher at the door in case he was being pursued, accidentally fired it, causing an explosion which took him down to two hearts of health. Toby evidently did not think to bring food with him, and was unable to heal from this accident.

Meanwhile, Remy had returned and recovered his items. Remy and Jasper then proceeded to search for Toby in Billzoplace City. They were unable to find Toby until Bill suggested to look in the chicken coop. Jasper was confused by this, but Remy, knowing that the chicken coop was in the Mailhouse, immediately headed over there.

Toby then fled from the Mailhouse and headed in to his [[Toby's Shady Building in Billzoplace|shady building]] through the S.E.K.S. Closet. Jasper managed to find the staircase hidden in the closet, heading up while Remy followed. Toby, still in ekto mode, had his nametag hidden from other players. He hid inside one of the walls by using a trick similar to the painting trick, jumping through one of the custom images pasted on his wall in the surveillance room.

At some point, Toby used an escape tunnel he had preprepared in the shady facility, dropping down it, punched through the wall into the [[Billzoplace Station]]-[[Sheapland Station]] [[Hata Railways|subway]] tunnel and catching a train towards Sheapland Station.

Remy and Jasper also found this tunnel and dropped down. The duo then split up, with Remy running through the tunnel towards Sheapland Station, while Jasper ran back towards Billzoplace.

Toby, after arriving at Sheapland station, went up the stairs and swam north, across the [[Sheap River]] and towards [[New Mangrovia]].

## Attempted Assassination at the UNHQ

Remy and Jasper then made their way to the [[United Nations|United Nations Headquarters]], intending to engage in negotiations with Toby regarding his contest of his own real, legitimate, and existent last will and testament.

Billzo was also there, arriving through legitimate means, and [[Arvi]] as well, who was teleported to the UN by Bill because he kept crashing the server by loading too many new chunks and didn't know how to get home.

Jasper encouraged everyone to take off their clothes because that would make him more comfortable.

Toby, after arriving at the UN with somehow yet another set of backup gear as well as a rocket launcher loaded with a big damage missile, attempted to fire it from the overhang down towards the negotiation table, intending to assassinate Jasper. Unfortunately, due to the 1.5 block tall hitbox of Minecraft fences, the missile collided with the fence instead of hitting Jasper, backfiring on Toby, killing him instantly.

Jasper, as the heir, inherited this set of backup armour as well.

## Jasper Shoots Toby

Jasper shot and killed Toby with his bow.

## Second Attempt at Negotiations in the UNHQ

Toby later showed up at the UNHQ a second time, this time intending to negotiate for real. He still brought yet another set of backup armour and a rocket launcher with big damage missiles though.

The negotatiations were rocky, with Toby immediately having a standoff with Remy, brandishing his rocket launcher at Remy while Remy drew his sword. Toby fired one missile, but failed to kill Remy, and the two insisted that the other put their weapon.

Jasper was not wearing anything during these negotiations.

The following were the main points brought up in the negotations:
- Toby offered Jasper the opportunity to join [[Tobytopia]], but Jasper declined, hoping to join Billzoplace instead.
- Jasper requested that Toby supply him with tools, but Toby rejected this, stating that he has no netherite tools to spare.
- Toby offered Jasper access to his enderender.
- Jasper returned the shulker box (provided by Billzo) with the inherited items inside. Remy also returned a stack of Toby's keycards.
- Jasper requested safe passage through Tobytopian territory, as well as enderender access + any farms that Toby would build in the future.
- Toby requested that everything, including his tools and armour to be returned immediately.
- Jasper pressed his request for enderender access.

These negotations were very tense, with Toby frequently pulling out his rocket launcher and pointing it at Remy and Jasper, while attempting to gaslight Remy into thinking that he was not holding a rocket launcher.

## Resolution

Toby cut the negotations short, quickly pulling out his rocket launcher and loosing several rockets at the opposite side of the table. He managed to kill Jasper after first popping his totem of undying, and after firing several more missiles at Remy, caused Remy to log out in fear.

As a result, Toby was able to get all his stuff back, as Jasper dropped the portion that he still had — the sword and bow — after Toby shot him.

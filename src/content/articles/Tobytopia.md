## Territorial Disputes

Tobytopia does not currently have any territorial disputes, but there are some notable past disputes that have errupted into conflict.

### New Mangrovia

*Main article: [[Great Mangrove War]]*

An area of mangrove trees planted by [[Holden]] in what used to be the savanna. This area was at some point claimed by Remy, but this claim was disputed by Toby and Holden since Holden, a Tobytopian, planted the trees.

When the conflict was resolved, it was agreed that the Remy Republic would own the area, but Holden would be awarded with the title of Founder of New Mangrovia.

### Unnamed Jungle Island

*Main article: [[Remy Republic#Jungle Island Incident]]*

This island, which is currently under Tobytopian sovereignty, was once part of a dispute with Remy. Remy had intended to claim this island, but forgotten, and Toby decided to claim it first.

## Coups and Takeovers

Tobytopia's history of being ruled by [[Toby]] has frequently been interrupted by coups and takeovers, usually lasting less than a single day, but occasionally holding on power for a little bit longer.

On 2023-01-22, [[Remy]] briefly took control of Tobytopia in the [[Good Neighbour Coup]]. It is notable that Remy did not do anything to alter the constitution of the country, and, from the perspective of Remy, he was simply doing what a good neighbour would do and looking after Tobytopia while Toby was missing. Although Toby did not appreciate Remy's initiative, this coup did not constitute a break in Tobytopia's continuity.

On 2023-05-07, [[Holden]] overthrew Toby, renaming Tobytopia to [[Holdentopia]] and moving the capital elsewhere. Toby would later execute a countercoup and restore a new Tobytopia to power.

On 2023-05-22, Doctor Zomboss, a character from the 2009 hit game *Plants vs Zombies*, overthrew Toby, briefly reorganising Tobytopia into the [[Zombitopian Junta]]. Toby would later retake power from Doctor Zomboss.

On 2023-06-26, a slime was able to overpower Toby while he was AFK, seizing control of the country and renaming it to [[Slimetopia]]. Toby was able to take back control on the same day, however.

From 2023-09-19 to 2023-09-26, for eight days, Tobytopia had again been taken over by Doctor Zomboss. Zomboss had, during this time, once again renamed the country to Zombitopia.

On 2023-10-25, *another* slime came and managed to kill Toby, renaming the country to [[Slimetopia]]. While in power, the slime also renamed [[Tobytown]] to Slime City, an action which was not undone by Toby until 2023-11-03, despite him having taken back control of the country on 2023-10-25.

## Fortuguese Rebellion

On 2023-02-25, General [[Che Forguera]] officially declared a state of war between the Fortuguese resistance fighters and the Tobytopian government. [[Toby]] initially did not at all acknoledge this insurrection, being too preoccupied constructing his large DVD player.

```

On 2023-04-29, General Forguera officially met with [[Remy]], Glorious Leader of the [[Remy Republic]]. The Glorious Leader generously offered assistance in the form of forgutarian aid and infrastructure projects to General Forguera's forces, which Forguera graciously accepted. Four days later, on 2023-05-03, the Remyan Parliament officially approved further diplomatic negotiations with Che Forguera's forces, though details are not yet known.

# Military

The Tobytopian military has one branch: the air force.

## Air Force

The Tobytopian Air Force is widely regarded as the most powerful air force on [[HATA 1]]. This is in no small part due to Tobytopia's seemingly endless supply of [[big damage missile|big damage missiles]], which its Air Force uses as its main ammunition type.

The Tobytopian Air Force, as the premier air force on the server, has also demonstrated that they are by a large margin significantly more powerful than the premier air force on the server, the Tobytopian Air Force. The Tobytopian Air Force has relatively frequent skirmishes with the Tobytopian Air Force, but in every single encounter between the Tobytopian Air Force and the Tobytopian Air Force, the Tobytopian Air Force has never once failed to achieve a major, if not decisive, victory over the Tobytopian Air Force.

> During the Tobytopian air raid on Hawainot, the Tobytopian Air Force heroicly swooped in to defend the citizens of Hawainot when the antiair defences were failing to take down [[Toby]], who was wreaking havoc in the skies of Hawainot. Toby struck and killed Toby while he was diving into the water in preparation to launch with his trident again.

The Tobytopian Air Force was the main orchestrator of the [[Election Night Shooting]] in [[Hawainot]].

The Tobytopian Air Force is frequently also deployed in [[Tobytown]]. The following is an image of the Tobytopian Air Force bombing a wagon in Tobytown for some strange reason:

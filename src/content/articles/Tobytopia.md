- Unnamed Jungle Island
- [[Tobytopian Southern Territories]]

# Territorial Disputes

## New Mangrovia

An area of mangrove trees planted by [[Holden]] in what used to be the savanna.
This area was at some point claimed by Remy, but this claim was disputed by Toby and
Holden since Holden, a Tobytopian, planted the trees.

When the conflict was resolved, it was agreed that the Remy Republic would own the area,
but Holden would be awarded with the title of Founder of New Mangrovia.

## Unnamed Jungle Island

This island, which is currently under Tobytopian sovereignty, was once part of a
dispute with Remy. Remy had intended to claim this island, but forgotten, and Toby
decided to claim it first.

## Remy's Coup

*Please see: [[Remy#(2023-01-22 to 2023-01-22): Interim Dictator of Tobytopia]]*

## Fortuguese Rebellion

On 2023-02-25, General [[Che Forguera]] officially declared a state of war between the Fortuguese resistance fighters and the Tobytopian government. [[Toby]] initially did not at all acknoledge this insurrection, being too preoccupied constructing his large DVD player.

On 2023-04-29, General Forguera officially met with [[Remy]], Glorious Leader of the [[Remy Republic]]. The Glorious Leader generously offered assistance in the form of forgutarian aid and infrastructure projects to General Forguera's forces, which Forguera graciously accepted. Four days later, on 2023-05-03, the Remyan Parliament officially approved further diplomatic negotiations with Che Forguera's forces, though details are not yet known.

### The Murder

At approximately 02:20 EDT on 2023-05-07, [[Holden]] staged a coup d'état by killing Toby in his cave base.

Holden reportedly calculated this murder meticulously. Toby had for some reason been on a single heart of health when he came down the elevator. Holden then started punching Toby, getting him down to half a heart, after which Toby logged out of the server in an attempt to prevent himself from being punched to death by Holden, probably hoping that Holden would just go away. Holden, in an act of genius, simply waited for Toby to log back on in the same place. After a few minutes, Toby did, in fact, log back in, and Holden was able to brutally beat Toby to death as soon as that happened.

By killing Toby, Holden managed to acquire everything Toby had on him at the time — his netherite armour and gear as well as his political authority. This included Toby's riptide trident, which allowed Holden to quickly escape the fray, utilising the ongoing thunderstorm to fly west into the jungle.

### Nation Renamed

![[Holden murders Toby.png]]

After acquiring power, Holden officially renamed the nation to *Holdentopia*, declared himself High Emperor, and decided to establish a new capital city in the jungle. Landing on a jungle tree, Holden used the stone that was in Toby's inventory and some jungle wood he harvested from the nearby trees to begin building a palace for his new capital.

### Toby's Countercoup

While Holden left to build his city, Toby had respawned and prepared to retake the throne from Holden. He gathered any gear he had remaining from his ender chest and storage system, including invisiblity potions, a crossbow, and four [[big damage missile|big damage missiles]] so that he could conduct a retalliatory assassination on Holden.

Toby soon tracked down Holden's exact location — the beach village on the northern coast of the nation. Toby rowed his boat to the village and splashed an invisibility potion on himself. He snuck closer to the village house in which Holden was hiding out and waited for Holden to come out of the front door. At approximately 02:30 EDT, as Holden stepped out of the door, Toby fired his big damage missile and instantly killed the usurper.

![[Toby blows up Holden.png]]

Toby picked up Holden's inventory off of the ground, reacquiring his gear and political power.

> Back in power, baby!

### Aftermath

Toby formally rerenamed the nation back to *Tobytopia*, making the following declarations regarding the administration of the nation:

1. The entire country, including the palace in the jungle, is to be under Tobytopian sovereignty.
2. Holden shall pay taxes.
3. Toby shall now be known by the title *His Highness, the Ultimate Kaiser of Doom Three Thousand of Tobytopia*
4. Holden shall now be known by the title *His Majesty, Peasant of Holdentopia*

Toby then flew to Holden's jungle palace, barring Holden from ever visiting the palace again except to pray. He also wrote several other incomprehensible declarations, but it is unknown exactly what they mean.

- [[Swamp of Secrets]] (AKA Tobytopian Mangrovia)
- Unnamed Jungle Island
- [[Tobytopian Southern Territories]]

# Territorial Disputes

## New Mangrovia

An area of mangrove trees planted by [[Holden]] in what used to be the savanna.
This area was at some point claimed by Remy, but this claim was disputed by Toby and
Holden since Holden, a Tobytopian, planted the trees.

When the conflict was resolved, it was agreed that the Remy Republic would own the area,
but Holden would be awarded with the title of Founder of New Mangrovia.

## Unnamed Jungle Island

This island, which is currently under Tobytopian sovereignty, was once part of a
dispute with Remy. Remy had intended to claim this island, but forgotten, and Toby
decided to claim it first.

## Coups and Takeovers

Tobytopia's history of being ruled by [[Toby]] has frequently been interrupted by coups and takeovers, usually lasting less than a single day, but occasionally holding on power for a little bit longer.

On 2023-01-22, [[Remy]] briefly took control of Tobytopia in the [[Good Neighbour Coup]]. It is notable that Remy did not do anything to alter the constitution of the country, and, from the perspective of Remy, he was simply doing what a good neighbour would do and looking after Tobytopia while Toby was missing. Although Toby did not appreciate Remy's initiative, this coup did not constitute a break in Tobytopia's continuity.

On 2023-05-07, [[Holden]] overthrew Toby, renaming Tobytopia to [[Holdentopia]] and moving the capital elsewhere. Toby would later execute a countercoup and restore a new Tobytopia to power.

On 2023-05-22, Doctor Zomboss, a character from the 2009 hit game *Plants vs Zombies*, overthrew Toby, briefly reorganising Tobytopia into the [[Zombitopian Junta]]. Toby would later retake power from Doctor Zomboss.

Other coups also took place, which are present in the timeline but do not have articles written as of yet.

## Fortuguese Rebellion

On 2023-02-25, General [[Che Forguera]] officially declared a state of war between the Fortuguese resistance fighters and the Tobytopian government. [[Toby]] initially did not at all acknoledge this insurrection, being too preoccupied constructing his large DVD player.

```

On 2023-04-29, General Forguera officially met with [[Remy]], Glorious Leader of the [[Remy Republic]]. The Glorious Leader generously offered assistance in the form of forgutarian aid and infrastructure projects to General Forguera's forces, which Forguera graciously accepted. Four days later, on 2023-05-03, the Remyan Parliament officially approved further diplomatic negotiations with Che Forguera's forces, though details are not yet known.

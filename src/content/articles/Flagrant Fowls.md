The Flagrant Fowls, from Discord's Bobble League, is the national team of the [[Remy Republic]]. They have been well renowned as an impressive, worthy, and GLORIOUS team.

The [[Remy|Glorious Leader]] was also the Glorious Leader of the Flagrant Fowls for a period of time. During this period, the team went undefeated in any game of Bobble League it played against any of the other teams in the game.

However, on 2023-06-06, the Glorious Leader was overthrown by [[Toby]] as captain of the team in a coup d'équipe. Although Toby, along with his accomplices in the coup — [[Billzo Shoom|Billzo]] and [[Arvi]] — led the team to a 5-1 victory in a 3v1 against Remy, who was forced to play as Troubles Bruin, Toby proved to be a less effective leader for the team. Under Toby's leadership, the Flagrant Fowls would eventually go on to lose its undefeated streak.

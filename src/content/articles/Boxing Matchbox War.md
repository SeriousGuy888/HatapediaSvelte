# Catalyst

## The Boxing Match

On `2023-07-06` at approximately `01:50`, [[Remy]] and [[Holden]] were having a boxing match in the [[Scammington Boxing Ring|Scammington Boxing Ring]]. Holden, who for some reason had [[Order 66|Order 66 spawn eggs]], derailed the boxing match by spawning several clone troopers in the ring, which immediately erupted in chaos from the missile explosions.

## Epique Chase

After the end of the Order 66 altercation, Holden and Remy were standing outside the boxing ring. Holden had taken all of Remy's tools from the barrel they were placed in before the boxing match, and he started whacking Remy with an axe, eventually bringing Remy down to one heart of health. A brief chase then ensued across Scammington, during which Holden tried to kill Remy. Remy then combatlogged to avoid being killed.

Holden then tried to kill Remy by digging a 2x2 hole where Remy logged out behind the [[Scammington Passport Office]], but this did not work, as Remy spawned in on a neighbouring block instead of over the hole when he logged back in again. As a result, it was not him, but *Holden* who got trapped in the hole. When Holden realised this, he tried to get out of the hole, but Remy was waiting for him at the surface. At `02:01`, Remy fired a [[big damage missile]] at Holden, which instantly killed him.

## Copyright Dispute

Although Holden had been defeated by Remy, he had nonetheless managed to deal significant damage to Remy, who had no food to heal and was still left on one heart of health. Just as Remy was celebrating his successful murder of Holden, an unexpected challenger approached from behind.

Within seconds, at `02:01`, [[Anna]] gently bonked Remy on the head with a shovel and instantly killed him. After assassinating the Glorious Leader, Anna removed Remy's armour from his corpse and fled the scene, running northeast towards [[Neville]].

The reason for Anna's assassination of the Glorious Leader was that she was very unhappy with Remy's *flagrant* copyright infringement. Remy had earlier the previous day applied the Coast armour trim, gifted to him by [[Arvi]], coloured with amethyst. Anna considered this to be her personal style, and was very disappointed in Remy for having the audacity to copy her.

Arriving at Neville, Anna tried to remove the armour trims with an anvil, but was soon informed that such a feature to remove armour trims does not exist in Minecraft and that the only way to remove the trims would be to apply a different set.

Anna then decided to keep the armour stored away in Neville until a settlement for the copyright issue could be agreed upon.

# Holden's Attempted Coup

## Battle of Fluffy Bridge

After Anna murdered Remy and stole his clothes, and with Holden in possession of all his netherite tools, Remy was forced to scrounge together whatever armour remained lying around in his ender chest and his room, which he had recently cleaned up of his own accord.

Holden approached Remy's house, brandishing a <ruby>rocket launcher<rt>crossbow</rt></ruby> loaded with big damage missiles. The two then had an epique battle on [[Fluffy Bridge]], during which, at `02:10`, Holden fired a big damage missile from his rocket launcher, presumably intending to kill Remy, but instead killing himself instantly.

![[holden blows up holden.png]]

Although this military assistance from Holdentopia against Holdentopia could have ended the war with a Remyan victory right then, Remy instead jumped off Fluffy Bridge and failed to collect the items from Holden's corpse. Remy's blunder at this moment led to Holden being able to respawn and collect his items before Remy could get them, allowing him to continue to terrorise Remy who was still without his armour and tools. He later said that he had jumped off the bridge in an attempt to escape the firework explosions.

## Holden Spawnkilling Remy

After Remy respawned in his house, Holden began to spawnkill Remy. He shot and killed the [[Remy|Glorious Leader]] several times, at one point placing him in a cauldron in his own house to cook him, spawn killing the Glorious Leader repeatedly. He threatened to make Remy the winner of the [[Death Race]] if he did not surrender over to Holden his rule over the [[Remy Republic]].

The Glorious Leader was killed by Holden a total of thirteen times during this encounter, which only ended at `02:14` when Remy broke his bed so that he could be sent back to spawn.

## Order 66 in No

Remy told Holden to meet him in [[No]], claiming that he would be willing to formally transfer rule of the Remy Republic over to Holden. However, when Holden arrived in No at `02:17`, Remy executed [[Order 66]], and Holden was shot and killed by one of the clone troopers by `02:18`.

Rockets from the clone troopers also reached the animal pens in No, killing much of Remy's livestock.

Further unfortunately for Remy, after calling off Order 66, he was unable to ascertain the location of Holden's death, and was unable to reclaim his items. This allowed Holden to find the items first and gave him considerable leverage in the subsequent negotiations.

## Negotiations Atop Arvi Tower

Remy and Holden met at [[Arvi Tower]] at approximately `02:20`, where Holden gave Remy his demands, dictating the following terms which would never come to fruition as Holden did not end up being able to get Remy to sign the treaty:

- The Remy Republic shall become an official colony of Holdentopia
- The Remy Republic shall henceforth be known as the Republic of Holdentopia (not to be confused with Holdentopia, Holdentopia, or Holden's Regime)
- Remy's new title shall be the Semiglorious Leader of the Republic of Holdentopia (a subsidiary of [[Holdentopia, Incorporated|Holdentopia, Inc.]])
- Holden's new title shall be the Glorious Not-Peasant of Holdentopia
- ~~At least 50% [[No]]'s wheat fields shall be repurposed for pumpkin production~~

Remy continuously drew out the negotiations, pretending to write in the book and quill provided to him to record the terms while he sent secret communications to [[Billzo Shoom|Bill]], requesting that he help to "assinate" Holden. (Holden was not assinated.)

### Anna's Arrival

At around `02:29`, Anna arrived back from Neville, having been unable to resolve the copyright issue. Climbing the ladder up the Arvi Tower, she joined Holden and started pointing her crossbow at Remy.

Remy tried to escape or attack his captors several times during the negotiations, and often ended up being shot by Anna or Holden.

When Holden ordered Remy to hand over the book and quill that Remy had been pretending to write in, he found that the book was actually blank. Because of this, Holden then decided to record the terms himself, having Anna, as his accomplice, continuing to keep her crossbow trained on Remy in order to prevent Remy from escaping.

## Remy's Excursion to Tobytopia

Unfortunately for Holden, Remy had secretly made an agreement with Anna behind Holden's back. When Remy promptly jumped off Arvi Tower and ran away towards the train station, Anna fired her crossbow at Remy while intentionally missing as per the secret agreement.

Remy boarded a boat and fled the country, heading to Toby's [[DVD Player]] in the [[Swamp of Secrets]], all the while telling Holden that he was near the territory of [[Holden's Regime]]. Remy went into [[Toby]]'s storage room and collected a set of netherite armour and an enchanted diamond sword from one of Toby's many backup kits. This was legal as Toby was presumed to be dead at the moment, meaning Remy was fully within his right to collect his inheritance.

# Remy's Countercoup

After making his way back to Arvi Tower, the Glorious Leader started to stab and slash every conceivable part of Holden's body. Holden jumped off the tower, calling for backup from Anna, who engaged Remy in a naval battle, wherein neither party managed to hit a single shot.

![[epique naval battle boxing matchbox war.png]]

The two returning to the mainland of No, Holden and Anna then chased Remy across [[Fluffy Bridge]] and across the [[Scammington]] Strait. Several [[Order 66]] spawn eggs were dropped out of the sky, and after Remy spawned in two clone troopers, chaos erupted across the beach and threw the pursuers into disarray to avoid being shot by the clone trooper missiles.

![[remy boxing matchbox war clone troopers chase anna.png]]

Remy cornered Holden in Scammington and stabbed him to death at `03:02` while he was begging for Anna's assistance. Anna was unable to arrive in time, and Remy succeeded in reclaiming his tools that Holden had been keeping from him.

Remy then called off Order 66.

## Attempted Escape

The failed revolutionaries attempted to flee on a boat, but they were spotted by Remy while they were just south of Fluffy Bridge. Remy swiftly gave chase, breaking the boat and stabbing Holden multiple times, after which Holden was struck by licit and legitimate lightning and then drowned as well.

![[holden and anna attempt to escape boxing matchbox war.png]]

Following Holden's death, Remy and Anna had a standoff, during which Remy threatened to burn down [[Neville]] if Anna continued to support Holden, urging her to step aside if she did not want this fate for the city. Anna accepted this deal, declaring her neutrality and making her way back to Neville, taming a dog on the way back home.

## Holden's Pyromania and Reign of Terror

Holden then started performing surprise harvests in No, flooding the wheat fields and causing major damage.

Holden used a flint and steel to set fire to many of the buildings in [[No]], [[Scammington]], and [[Forgsville]]. This damaged many buildings, among which the most damaged was [[Arvi Tower]], which was almost entirely destroyed.

The wheat gods set the weather to rain in an attempt to quell the inferno, but this was not very successful.

# Aftermath

## Remy Threatens to Quit Hata

Remy threatened to quit [[HATA]] over Holden's extreme actions in burning down much of No, but Holden was able to clear up the misunderstanding, saying that he recognised that he had gone too far and offered to help Remy repair and help Remy write further lore in the future.

## Buildings Damaged in the Fire

Buildings that sustained damage due to Holden's pyromaniacal actions included:

| Structure                        | Level of Damage |

# Reactions

## Harry Toothbrush

> What the fucking hell just happened? Who burned down my goddamn house?? Where the fuck am I supposed to watch my goddamn *Tom and Jerry* now? That son of a bitch going to pay for this.
> 
> ―[[Harry Toothbrush]], still not laughing, instead exclaiming expletives at anyone who will listen

## Fletcher Quadratic

General [[Fletcher Quadratic]], living on [[Equalsosceles Island]], [[Hawainot]], remained blissfully unaware of the turmoil in No throughout the entirety of the affair. He reportedly achieved an above-average quality of sleep due to the lack of crazed laughter from Harry Toothbrush, but woke up to concerning smoke on the horizon to the east.

> What a beautiful morning. Wait, what's that smoke over there?
> ―Fletcher Quadratic

# Political Consequences

## Remy Republic

[[Remy]], after the event, as the Glorious Leader of the [[Remy Republic]], announced his intention to temporarily close the borders of the Remy Republic in order for the country to recover.

The Glorious Leader also later officially abolished squatters rights in the Remy Republic, as that was one of the justifications that Holden used in his attempted takeover of the country.

## Holden's Title

Although the terms that [[Holden]] had imposed upon Remy did not end up being signed, Holden still decided to implement one of the terms anyway. As of `2023-07-06`, Holden officially updated his title from the *Peasant of Holdentopia* (imposed upon him by [[Toby]] after [[Tobytopia#Holden's Coup|Holden's failed coup]]) to the *Glorious Not-Peasant of Holdentopia*.

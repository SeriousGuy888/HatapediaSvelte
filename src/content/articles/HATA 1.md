**HATA 1**, also spelled **Hata 1** or **hata1**, also known as **HATAsurv**, contemporaneously referred to as simply **HATA** or **Hata**, even further back, originally known as **HATAwar**, was the first season of [[HATA]].

# History

## HATAwar Era

HATA 1 first opened on 2022-12-02. It was originally intended as a war server, somewhat similar in spirit to the fictional and hypothetical "'"'"'"'"'"'"'"[[Polyoktosurv|cheezsurvnations]]"'"'"'"'"'"'"'". It was to be a server where the members would build nations and fight, with their movement restricted within a 1000-block (diameter) world border centered on Spawn.

Members of HATA 1 were, generally speaking, quite scattered, living separately across the world. Some players, such as [[Toby]] and [[Arvi]], tried to hide their bases, while others, such as [[Remy]] and [[Billzo]] made no attempt to do so.

## HATAsurv Era

On 2023-06-21, HATA 1 officially transitioned from being a war server to a more regular style SMP, similar in spirit to [[Polyoktosurv|CheezSurv]].

The worldborder was changed from a 1000 block diameter, centered on spawn, to a 10,000 block diameter, centered on (0, 0). This change to the worldborder was briefly preceded by the [[Border Disorder]].

> Speaking of our wonderful artist and news reporter, we've had some change in administration with 3 promotions!! First off \[@[[Anna]]\] has been promoted to Member!! thanks so much for your service Anna, we've been super duper grateful for your 3 total messages on the server, and we hope you enjoy you're well needed rest. Second off I'd like to promote \[@[[Billzo]]\] to Admin!! Billzo has always been op'ed on the server and he really deserved this one. And last... since \[@[[Remy]]\] refused to give me Hawainot for it I guess he's a reporter now.

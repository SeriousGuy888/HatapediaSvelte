**The Cow Jumped over the Spoon** is a bar selling alcoholic drinks in [[Scammington]] and is a successor to the [[Scammington Bar]] which burned down. The Cow Jumped over the Spoon was built in late June by [[Remy]], and it opened on 2025-06-28, with the promise that its owner is nonpyromaniacal in nature and will *not* burn down this time.

Though it serves mostly alcoholic beverages, the Cow Jumped over the Spoon also sells nonalcoholic drinks such as water and chocolate milk.

Like its predecessor, the Cow Jumped over the Spoon also has a fireplace and a jukebox ‚Äî the same jukebox, in fact, from the original Scammington Bar ‚Äî though it is greatly expanded in terms of seating and overall size and greatly improved in terms of visual design.

# History

The grand opening was attended by [[Remy]], the owner; [[Birch Nuke]], the newly hired bartender who moved back to Scammington from [[No]] precisely for the sake of this job; and the [[Billzo|God of News]], there to report the event.

The name of the establishment comes from when, on 2025-06-20, Billzo posted a picture of the bar under construction with the caption "spoon detected ‚ö†Ô∏èü•Ñ", which later inspired Remy to choose "The Cow Jumped over the Spoon" as the name of the then unnamed establishment.

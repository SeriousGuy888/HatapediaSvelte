Remyforg is not generally considered one of [[The Voices|the voices]].

# Early Life

Remyforg was first seen at the start of [[HATA 1]] near spawn. His exact origins are unclear, but due to the involvement of the [[Billzo|God of News]] in his creation, he is generally considered a manifestation and personification of the power of news.

[[Remy]] and [[Arvi]] decided to put Remyforg in a boat, and [[Remy]] took him over Forgsville.

# Rollercoaster Junkie

Remyforg lives in [[Forgsville]] and can usually be found riding the [[Forgsville Rollercoaster]] around the clock.

Remyforg's enthusiasm for the rollercoaster has caused great dismay for [[Toby]], who had agreed to sell [[No]] to the Remy Republic in exchange for a lifetime membership on the Forgsville Rollercoaster, but has never been able to ride the rollercoaster due to Remyforg's refusal to get off.

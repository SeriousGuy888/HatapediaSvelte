# Heist

On `2023-12-31`, [[Batman]] the Camel was kidnapped, taken, by [[Holden]] and [[Anna]], from his home on the [[Untitled Mushroom Island]] in the [[HATA Piracy Corporation]] to the [[Bilge Rats]]' island.

Batman was placed in a stable constructed of dirt and covered in sea pickles, most likely the result of Holden's shady pickle breeding experiments.

# Counterheist

After learning that Batman was missing, [[Hoang]] and [[Toby]] went over to the Bilge Rats' island and stole it back.

Remy also died somehow during this event. I'm not sure how.

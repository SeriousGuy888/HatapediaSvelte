In the [[Remy Republic]], there are four major media outlets: three newspapers and one magazine. The newspapers include *Remy Republic News* (*RRN*), *Flufftail News*, and *Le No Gazette*. *FORGS Magazine* is the most popular magazine publication of the Remy Republic. 

# Origin

All four of these publications were created for the purpose of broadcasting the Remy Republic's stories and news to the [[HATA 1|HATA]] community while highlighting a Remyan perspective. This was because the *God of News* network, HATA's main news network, previously only allowed [[Billzo]] to write in the news channel. [[Toby]] denied [[Remy]] the ability to write in the news channel because Toby worried that Remy would write with a bias against Tobytopia. Remy was able to work around this by writing in a newspaper style Google Doc and sending it to Billzo as an image for him to post. Eventually, Remy was allowed to write in the *God of News* channel, but the classic newspaper style still pops up once in a while.

# List of Outlets

## *Remy Republic News*

*Remy Republic News*, or *RRN*, is the oldest of the three major newspaper publications headquartered in the Remy Republic. Its name may or may not be a reference to *CNN*. *Remy Republic News* was created so that Remyan news and events would be fully reported to HATA’s general public. *RRN* was also created on the basis of helping promote Remyan culture and highlighting areas in the nation that need improvement. While they spend a lot of time writing about the Slimeball Party, *RRN* says that they aim to remain unbiased in their portrayals of events and are not afraid to critique the [[Remy|Glorious Leader]] when they need to. It is said that they will be receiving a new headquarters in Hawainot very soon.

*RRN* is by far the most popular outlet of the Remy Republic, with nearly 67% of all Remyan citizens having a subscription. It is also one the most popular publications in all of HATA, sitting only behind *God of News* and *FORGS Magazine*.

## *Flufftail News*

*Flufftail News* is the second oldest of the three major news publications in the Remy Republic. Its name is a reference to *Fox News*, where the word “*flufftail*” in Billzonian translates to the English word “fox”. *Flufftail News* was created by those strongly aligned with the Magma Cream Party as an avenue to publicly criticize The Glorious Leader. While a majority of *Flufftail News*’ pieces are attack pieces against the Glorious Leader, other articles include a summary of recent events in the Remy Republic. *Flufftail News* will be reviewing a new headquarters in [[Hawainot]] very soon, however many subscribers are petitioning to have it be built in [[New Mangrovia]] instead. 

*Flufftail News* is less popular than *RRN* in the Remy Republic, with only 28% of Remyan citizens being subscribers. Interestingly, a study found that 55% of [[Tobytopia|Tobytopians]] surveyed were actually subscribed to this network. The study’s authors believe this to be because the [[Toby|Ultimate Kaiser of Doom 3000, Toby]], is a huge fan of the paper for its criticism of RemyHemy, the Glorious Leader. 

## *Le No Gazette*

*Le No Gazette* is the youngest of the three major news publications in the Remy Republic. Its name is inspired by the *Montréal Gazette*. It was created to promote and unite the voices of the province of [[No]]; as such, it mainly covers provincial news or how new Remyan regulations and laws will affect No. The *Gazette* is also the first and only fully French publication in the Remy Republic. This was done to help promote the French language in No; however, due to instability in the form of wars and conflicts in or around No (see: [[No#Wars]]), the *Gazette* has not been able to publish very many articles, and has therefore not been very successful in fulfilling its stated purpose of promoting the French language. The *Gazette* is the favourite newspaper of the Bloc Nobecois, as it often shares the same ideals with the party. The *Gazette* will be receiving a headquarters in No at some point, but it is unclear when this will be, due to other projects in the Remy Republic being higher priority. 

## *FORGS Magazine*

While its focus is not on news per se, *FORGS Magazine* is the largest Remy Republic based publication in HATA with over 87% of all HATA citizens having a subscription. Its name is based on Peoples Magazine. *FORGS Magazine* was originally designed to help the [[Fortugal|Fortuguese]] community of Tobytopia and New Mangrovia engage with the ongoing events of the HATA World. Since its humble beginnings, *FORGS* has expanded, becoming an influential magazine publication filled with polls and list rankings regarding the HATA World. Some of their most notable publications include their rankings, based on a survey they ran, of the best places to live in HATA, as well as of each nation's happiness rankings. *FORGS Magazine* will have a headquarters built in Scammington but may also build offices in [[Billzoplace]], [[Neville]], and [[Tobytopia]] if their expansion plans are approved.

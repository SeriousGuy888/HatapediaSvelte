# Shenanigans

## Coup on Tobytopia

Holden staged a coup on [[Tobytopia]], renaming the country and proclaiming himself to be the country's new *High Emperor*. This coup was very short lived as [[Toby]] successfully staged a countercoup just 10 minutes later.

Please see: [[Tobytopia#Holden's Coup]]

## Attempted Takeover of the Remy Republic

Holden attempted to overthrow the [[Remy Republic]], igniting the massively damaging [[Boxing Matchbox War]], during which he killed [[Remy]] several times and teamed up with [[Anna]] to try to make Remy sign over control of the country.

Although the coup was not successful, Holden still decided to update his title regardless, changing it from from the *Peasant of Holdentopia* (imposed upon him by [[Toby]] after [[Tobytopia#Holden's Coup|his failed coup]]) to the *Glorious Not-Peasant of Holdentopia*.

## Mushroom War

Holden formed a coalition with [[Arvi]] and [[Anna]] during the [[Mushroom War]] just before the unintentional [[Mushroom War#Raid on No|Raid on No]]. Holden would die six times during his participation in the war.

**Remy's Home Sweet Home** is the name of [[Remy]]'s house in [[Forgsville]].

# History

## Creation

Remy's Home Sweet Home was built by [[Arvi]] in late December 2022 during Remy's vacation when he was not playing on [[HATA 1]]. Arvi says that Remy's Home Sweet Home may be the first Minecraft house he has ever built.

It was around this same time that [[Billzo]], having been appointed provisional leader of the [[Remy Republic]], was [[No#Expansion of the Wheat Field|rapidly expanding the wheat field in No]].

## Addition of a Second Floor

In July 2025, Remy started work on an expansion to his Home Sweet Home in the form of a second floor. It is still under construction as of writing (2025-07-23).

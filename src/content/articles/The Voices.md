**The Voices** are an invisible entity that manifests as voices in the heads of certain people while they are playing on the [[HATA]] server.

[[Remy]], the Glorious Leader of the [[Remy Republic|Remy Republic]], was the first member known to have interactions with these Voices, but other members, including [[Toby]], and characters such as [[Harry Toothbrush]] have also been observed apparently speaking with or being influenced by an unseen entity.

The study of the Voices is sometimes referred to as **voicelore**, and scientists that study voicelore may be called **vocologists**.

# Manifestations

## Noncorporeal

Although collectively, they are often colloquially referred to as the Voices, many vocologists, based on observations of people ostensibly "talking to the Voices", believe that the Voices are not just a single entity. People observed during their interactions with the Voices do not always act the same way while talking to the Voices.

Though different vocologists have slightly different lists, most agree that that among the Voices, some of the Voices with the most prominent and distinct personalities include
- The Laughs — believed to frequently interact with [[Remy]] and [[Harry Toothbrush]]
- The Hornies — with [[Toby]]

## Corporeal

Though the scentific community is uncertain on whether the Voices may manifest as corporeal beings, it is nonetheless a common belief, especially in the folk beliefs of [[Remy Republic|Remyans]] and [[Billzoplace|Billzoplacians]], that the Voices can sometimes possess people in order to do their bidding.

### Netherrack Incident

In one particular instance which some point to as evidence of the Voices' ability to possess people, Remy started noticing that netherrack keeps appearing behind him whenever he opens chests, crafting tables, or furnaces.

It is suspected that the placer of these netherrack blocks is, in fact, the Voices themselves, messing with Remy. Remy was, at the time, urged to pay no attention to these strange activities because the Voices are only real if you make them real.

Remy was extremely disturbed by these occurences, believing them to be caused by some sort of incorporeal beings, such as ghosts. In order to prevent this from happening again in the future, Remy decided to put up a Ghostbusters poster up on his wall. This *may* have been effective, as the netherrack incident appears not to have recurred since.

As [[Toby]] was one of the only other people online at the time, many Remyans believe that this was actually Toby's doing while he was being possessed by the Voices.

# Influence

It is difficult to ascertain exactly how much influence the Voices have on the progression of the HATA plot or the integrity of its timeline and canon. Some vocologists believe that the Voices are merely an emergent phenomenon arising from the free will of the characters of HATA, rather than an autonomous entity per se, and that any influence that may be attributed to the Voices should really be attributed to the free will of the actors in HATA. Other vocologists believe that the Voices have influence that may extend far further and deeper than can be practically observed through experimental observation. The dominant consensus in the field of voicelore, however, is somewhere in between the two extremes.

## Altering the Canon of HATA

[[Toby]] has frequently accused [[Remy]] of reporting news and writing HATApedia articles based on what the Voices tell him rather than based on canonical events.

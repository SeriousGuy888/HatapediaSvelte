## Netherrack Incident

There was an incident where, one day, Remy started noticing that netherrack keeps appearing behind him whenever he opens chests, crafting tables, or furnaces.

It is suspected that the placer of these netherrack blocks is, in fact, the Voices themselves, messing with Remy. Remy was, at the time, urged to pay no attention to these strange activities because the Voices are only real if you make them real.

Remy was extremely disturbed by these occurences, believing them to be caused by some sort of incorporeal beings, such as ghosts. In order to prevent this from happening again in the future, Remy decided to put up a Ghostbusters poster up on his wall. This *may* have been effective, as the netherrack incident appears not to have recurred since.

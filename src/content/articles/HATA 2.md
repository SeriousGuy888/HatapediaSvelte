**HATA 2**, also spelled **Hata 2** or **hata2**, is the second season of [[HATA]].

# History

## Conceptualisation

A new season of HATA was proposed (by [[Toby]] i think) due to the inactivity of [[HATA 1]], with the major members, who had been greatly involved, of [[Arvi]] and [[Anna]] having become very inactive, finding the server to have become stale.

The idea to start HATA 2 was met by some protest from [[Remy]] and [[Billzo]].

## Opening

HATA 2 first opened on 2023-12-27, and, unlike [[HATA 1]], HATA 2 was intended as a survival multipler server from the very start, and, as such, no worldborder was defined this time.

Unlike HATA 1, it was hosted on Minefort rather than Minehut because Minehut had recently introduced a new daily uptime limit for free servers hosted there, making it extremely impractical to use it.

## Ender Dragon Fight

The ender dragon is still yet to be slain on HATA 2 as of writing (2024-05-06).

### Leadup

On 2024-01-01, Toby posted an announcement requesting that nobody kill the ender dragon, as it should be a community event.

> [[Toby]]:
> Don’t kill the enderdragon btw

Eventually, with some amount of badgering from [[Adam]], Toby posted a poll on 2024-03-12, asking members if they wanted to kill the ender dragon during March break. The poll passed with four votes in favour and one in opposition.

> [[Toby]]:
> @everyone do you wanna kill the ender dragon this break
> `❌2` `✅5`

However, this poll was for naught, as March break came and went without the dragon being slain.

# Aftermath

The Glorious Leader, [[Remy]], who was present at the shooting, immediately revoked Toby's right to vote in Remyan elections. However, this punishment was short lived, as the Glorious Leader was very quickly intimidated by Toby, who shot fireworks at the Glorious Leader, into reinstating his voting rights.

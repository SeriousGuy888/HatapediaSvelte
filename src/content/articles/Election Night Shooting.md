On 2023-02-16, the night of the [[Remy Republic#Election|Remyan election]], fireworks (believed to be [[big damage missile|big damage missiles]]) shot from a crossbow exploded and killed two resident villagers on [[Equalsosceles Island]] in [[Hawainot]]. Several more villagers were wounded but not killed.

# Victims

- Lila Oolahist (deceased)
- Lucas Staline Quadratic (deceased)
- (several more, wounded)

# Perpetrator

[[Toby]], acting on behalf of the [[Tobytopia#Air Force|Tobytopian Air Force]].

# Aftermath

The Glorious Leader, [[Remy]], who was present at the shooting, immediately revoked Toby's right to vote in Remyan elections. However, this punishment was short lived, as the Glorious Leader was very quickly intimidated by Toby, who shot fireworks at the Glorious Leader, into reinstating his voting rights.

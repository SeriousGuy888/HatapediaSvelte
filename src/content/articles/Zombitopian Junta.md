Zombitopia was a short-lived [<ruby>junta<rt>ˈhʊntə</rt></ruby>](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/junta) state that came into being when [[Doctor Zomboss]] overthrew [[Toby]] while he was AFK for some reason.

# Zomboss's Coup

On 2023-05-22 at 19:30, [[Toby]], Ultimate Kaiser of Doom Three Thousand of [[Tobytopia]], was killed by Doctor Zomboss, from hit game, Plants vs Zombies, while he was AFK.

This was noticed by [[Remy]], who announced his recognition of the coup.

> As Tobytopian tradition indicates, it seems that Zombie is now the leader of Tobytopia
> —[[Remy]], 22:00

It was not until 9 minutes after this recognition that Toby, the late Ultimate Kaiser of Doom Three Thousand, realised this had happened.

> Holy shit I’ve been afk for like 4 hours
> ―[[Toby]], 22:09

Toby was killed by Doctor Zomboss for a second time at 22:11.

# Proclamation of Zombitopia

At 19:30, after killing Toby, Doctor Zomboss officially announced his seizure of control of the Tobytopian Empire.

In a hardly comprehensible speech atop Toby's [[DVD Player|yet to be finished palace]], Zomboss declared that the country would henceforth be known as *Zombitopia*, with himself as *Brains of the Operation*.

## Banner

It is worth noting that Zomboss did not make any statement with regards to the national flag. [[Hata]] historians therefore generally take the preexisting Tobytopian banner as the standard used by Zombitopia.

However, it is worth noting that there are no actual records of contemporary use of the banner by the Zombitopian administration, on account of the government being overthrown like thirteen minutes later.

# Deposition

At approximately 22:13, Toby killed Doctor Zomboss back, retaking his political authority.

Unfortunately for Toby, many of his items — all except those picked up by Zomboss — had despawned. This included his
- trident
- chestplate
- shield
- all tools except his axe

## Reproclamation of Tobytopia

At approximately 22:45, Toby made a proclamation to the nation, announcing that he had regained control of the government. In this proclamation, Toby rerererenamed the country back to Tobytopia and restored himself as the Ultimate Kaiser of Doom Three Thousand.

In a slightly more comprehensible speech than that of Zomboss, Toby made the following statement:

> This is a great time of loss, of grief, for me, my family, for all of Tobytopia together, but it really shows our unitedness and our resolve to go against our problems. It also shows the power of Tobytopia, that this, which would be a great loss for countries like the [[Remy Republic]] and [[Billzoplace|Billzo Land]]<sup>[sic]</sup>, is something we can overcome. It's a testament to our power, our willpower, that we can get this back...
> 
> ...That's the real story of this tragedy here today.

In this proclamation, Toby also officially set the capital of the country as the [[DVD Player]] and officially made the motto of the country "*Tobytopia togethəəəəəəəəəəər strong*".

# Aftermath

## Economic Impacts

Due to the political instability in Tobytopia, investors and foreign creditors pulled out of Tobytopia in droves. Stocks in the Topytobia Stock Exchange (TSX) rapidly dropped in value, with investors who were not fast enough to sell their stocks watching in horror as their portfolios plummetted to zero in minutes.

Even after the initial scramble, for weeks afterwards, Remyan investors would still spit on their blueberry-banana milkshakes in shock whenever presented with the notion of investing in Tobytopia.

## Reputational Impacts

This coup created shifts in international perspectives on Tobytopia, with many no longer viewing Tobytopia as a formidable threat.

### Laughing at Tobytopia

There was one particular instance, where the dynamic duo, [[Harry Toothbrush]] and [[the Laughs]], were watching *Tom and Jerry* on television in the [[Arvi Tower]] when their regularly scheduled programming was interrupted by the news of Tobytopia being overthrown.

Despite their initial dismay at this interruption, the news, which was a level of hilarity that they had never even experienced from watching *Tom and Jerry*, was reportedly found very entertaining by Toothbrush and the Laughs.

Almost eight in-game days passed in the 2 hours and 39 minutes between the initial coup and Toby taking notice. During this time, the entirety of [[No]] was immersed and saturated in the immense volume of the sound of Toothbrush and the Laughs' unrelenting laughter. This laughter was so loud that giggles could be faintly heard even all the way in eastern [[Hawainot]].

> Who the hell is giggling? Where is that coming from? Why can I hear it through my pillow?
> ―[[Fletcher Quadratic]], in eastern Hawainot, trying to sleep

With over a week of Remyan workers going to work drowsy and unattentive, economists have estimated that Doctor Zomboss's coup may have caused up to 75,000 [[Republicoin]] (for whatever that's worth) in economic damage to the [[Remy Republic]] in the form of lost productivity. Although many laugh at Tobytopia, it seems that this coup has far wider ripples than just within Tobytopia.

## Refugee Crisis

Due to this political instability, the Immigration and Passport Office of the [[Remy Republic]] was being rapidly flooded with immigration requests, requests for political asylum, and refugees crossing the border illegally.

As these refugees were mainly forgs, whose preferred climate was very similar to that of [[New Mangrovia]], that is where most of the refugees crossed into the Remy Republic. Some forgs were also reported having crossed the border into Billzoplace, but most used it as a jumping off point to head to New Mangrovia.

On 2023-06-04, Immigration and Passport Office announced that it had begun processing the mountain of immigration requests resultant from the coup. Exact numbers are unclear, but almost all of the refugees wished to resettle in New Mangrovia.

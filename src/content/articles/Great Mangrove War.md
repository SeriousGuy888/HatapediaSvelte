The Great Mangrove War was a conflict between the [[Remy Republic]] and [[Tobytopia]] (more specifically, [[Holden]] from Tobytopia). The disagreement was over which nation should have sovereignty over [[New Mangrovia]] (then referred to by Remy as Remyan Mangrovia).

## Remy Claims the Mangrove

On 2022-12-21 at 21:07 EDT, the [[Remy|Glorious Leader of the Remy Republic]], standing atop a tree and wearing [[Billzo|Billzo]]'s Minecraft skin, made a speech which formally laid claim to the area of savanna that would become known as Remyan Mangrovia which was covered by mangrove trees planted by Holden.

> I CLAIM HOLDEN'S MANGROVE TREES IN THE NAME OF THE REMY REPUBLIC!

## Holden's Response

[[Holden]] threatened Remy with war over the territory, but the war did not occur until much later.

Holden and Remy disagreed on who had the right to own the territory.
- Holden stated that he, as the planter of the trees in the area and architect of the forest, constituted the founder, even if he did not formally lay claim.
- Remy maintained that "[[finders, keepers; losers, weepers]]" was the official policy position of the [[Remy Republic]] and offered to sell the territory to Holden for a price — specifically the Dragon Egg, which was in the possession of [[Tobytopia]].

## Tobytopian Position

Holden, being a Tobytopian subject, was backed by [[Tobytopia]]. On 2023-01-04, [[Toby]], the then untitled leader of Tobytopia, officially claimed Remyan Mangrovia as Tobytopian territory.

# Mangrovepox

In retalliation to Remy's claims, Holden continued to plant mangrove trees like he had done to create what is now New Mangrovia, this time planting them in [[No]] and [[Forgsville]] in a self-described act of ecoterrorism.

This rapid spread of mangrove trees starting on 2023-01-05 would become known as [[Mangrovepox]], which forced the Remy Republic to close its borders and restrict travel across internal administrative boundaries.

> 
> Mangrove trees have been spotted in the core territories of the Remy Republic. They have grown on top of Remyan buildings in Forgsville, the first province of the Remy Republic as well as in No, the core of the Remy Republic's agricultural industry. Experts had previously predicted that the Remy Republic would have more time to prepare for the treespores, but it seems that they have just been proven wrong.

> 
> The Remyan government has now closed borders for the provinces of No, Forgsville, and Scammington. Those with citizenship may still enter these territories, but will be required to stay until the area may be cleared of mangrove trees.
> 
> Additionally, the Remyan government has recommended quarantining for residents of No and Forgsville. For any required excursions, the government recommends wearing a mask and remaining six meters apart.
> 
> Mangrovepox is currently believed to only affect trees, and so the Remyan government does not believe a vaccine to be necessary. The government does, however, plan to chop down trees which are causing the problem, a drastic measure. They also intend on pressuring the Tobytopian authorities to punish Holden.

# Epique Violencing

On 2023-01-22, after Holden and Toby came to Forgsville and tried to burn down Remy's house, Remy retalliated by burning down a large portion of the Swamp of Secrets in Tobytopia. This crisis boiled over into an epique duel between Remy and Holden, which Remy would win 2 to 1.

# Resolution

On the same day, as a result of the Remyan victory, Remy and Holden came to the following agreement.
- Remy gets to own Remyan Mangrovia
- Remyan Mangrovia will be renamed to New Mangrovia
- Holden gets the title of Founder of New Mangrovia
- Holden gets to cleanup the mess from the crisis

Toby would later allude to not recognising this settlement between Remy and Holden,
saying that he might just invade and retake the territory for Tobytopia again. However,
Toby never acted on these threats, and New Mangrovia remains a Remyan territory.

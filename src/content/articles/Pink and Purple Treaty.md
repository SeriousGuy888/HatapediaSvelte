The **Pink and Purple Treaty**, also known as the **PP Treaty**, was a treaty of alliance between the [[Remy Republic]] and the [[Neville|Kingdom of Neville]], signed on 2023-07-13.

The treaty was effectively a formalisation of an already existing informal alliance between the two countries. The treaty was signed only a few days after the conclusion of the [[Mushroom War]] on 2023-07-09.

The Pink and Purple Treaty was so named as an allusion to the national colours of the parties to the treaty: pink for Neville and its cherry blossoms, and purple for the Remy Republic and its amethyst.

The treaty formally precluded the possibility of war between the two signatories, as well as defining a commitment between the Remy Republic and Neville to come to each other's aid in times of hardship and outside aggression, specifically naming [[Tobytopia]] as one of these outside threats. The treaty also established open borders between the two states, with citizens of either being free to enter the other.

# Effectiveness

The PP Treaty was, by all accounts, not very effective. Though the treaty committed both parties to mutual aid in times of hardship, neither country did provide such aid in subsequent times of hardship.

When [[Cheezillia]] declared war on Neville, the Remy Republic decided to stay neutral.

# Termination

Due to the failure of the treaty to serve its intended purpose, the Pink and Purple treaty was eventually terminated by bilateral abrogation.

## Nevillian Withdrawal

The Kingdom of Neville was first to withdraw from the PP Treaty, releasing a video on 2023-10-25 declaring its exit.

In the announcement video, [[Arvi]] said the following:

> I'm breaking up with you, Remy. You broke our relationship; you're not loyal, [...].
> 
> He did break the treaty. When [[Hoang|Markie]] declared war on me, …, I asked [for] help from the Remy Republic, and they stayed neutral.
> 
> …
> 
> Fuck you, Remy ❤️

### Remyan Challenge

The following day, the Remy Republic refused to honour Arvi's withdrawal from the treaty, intending to contest it in court, as [[Remy]] disagreed with Arvi's justification, believing himself not to have been in contravention of the treaty. The Remy Republic also maintained that the PP Treaty contained neither a protocol for parties to withdraw, nor one which could allow for its own annulment, making Neville's withdrawal illegal. 

Arvi hired [[Toby]] as his lawyer to defend his case, though the case did not end up going to court due to Remy relenting soon after.

## Remyan Withdrawal

Two days after the Nevillian withdrawal from the treaty, on 2023-10-27, [[Remy]] decided not to move forward with his legal contestation of the Nevillian withdrawal and withdrew the Remy Republic from the treaty as well.

> Frankly[,] the PP treaty caused more pain then good. The ideals of the Remy Republic and Neville just do not align.
> —RemyHemy, Glorious Leader of the Remy Republic

From this moment, the Pink and Purple Treaty was officially no longer in force, having lasted 104 days from 2023-07-13 after the initial signing, to 2023-10-25, when Neville released their announcement video.

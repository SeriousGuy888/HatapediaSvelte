The *Treaty of No (2023)* was a followup to the first Treaty of No. This treaty allowed the [[Remy Republic]] free access to [[Billzo Shoom]]'s slime farm beneath the newly constructed [[Limedye Oil Rig]].

The access was free because the previous [[Treaty of No (2022)]] already authorised [[Billzoplace]] free access to the Remyan wheat from the wheat fields in [[No]]. This treaty effectively added to the previous agreement, making it a wheat-for-slime trade agreement between the Remy Republic and the Billzoplace City State.

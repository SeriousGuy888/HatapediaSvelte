# Career

## Background Character

Music was originally introduced as a background character, and not much is known about his early life. He was presumably promoted to the Chairman of the Wheat Committee within a few days before 2023-10-07.

## Chairman of the Wheat Committee

When Music was first promoted to the Chairman of the [[Committee for the Wheat Field of the Province of No|Wheat Committee]], he started a mid-scale wheat field expansion campaign, not to the level as the original explosive expansion during [[Billzo]]'s reign as Provisional Glorious Leader of the Remy Republic, but not at all insignificant either. Music's wheat field expansion campaign was celebrated, cheered on, and long anticipated by the citizens of No.

### Campaign for the Removal of the Crazy Straw Grave

Music had his first line of dialogue on 2023-10-07, when the Wheat Committee, under his direction, formally sought federal approval from the Remyan government to bulldoze the [[Crazy Straw Grave]] built by [[Holden]] so that they could use the land it was built on to continue expanding the No Wheat Field.

> That crazy straw is such a blemish on the land! This place will look so much better when we can get rid of it and replace it with stalks of glorious, golden wheat — glorious like our Glorious Leader.
> ―Liam Staig Music, Chairman of the Committee

The Crazy Straw Grave, having been built by [[Holden]] as a protest to [[Remy]]'s felling of mangrove trees planted by Holden throughout the Remy Republic during [[Mangrovepox]], was generally viewed negatively by residents of No, who mostly supported Music campaign to remove it:

> Mangrovepox was a painful era for all of us. I don't see why we should be obligated to keep a memorial of this disease around.
> —[[Billzo Caterpillar]], local farmer

…although some did fear Holden's potential retribution if they did go through with the plan:

> This Holden guy sounds pretty threatening. He came and [[Boxing Matchbox War|burned down the country once]], didn't he?
> —[[Liam Frog]], misprint in the cowpen

On the next day, 2023-10-08, [[Holden]] issued a statement in response to the Wheat Committee's announcement, vaguely threatening retalliation of the "lowest ratio of effort to impact" if the Remy Republic dared desecrate the grave.

This statement caused some to waver in their support for Music's plan, though Music remained insistent.

> This Holden guy is up to no good, I'm telling you. What if he starts a new mangrovepox pandemic?
> —[[Liam Frog]]

> Wheat is wheat. This grave is blocking the way to more wheat.
> —[[Liam Staig Music]]

It was [[Liam Frog Ashwin]] who first suggested the idea of selling the gravestone back to Holden instead of bulldozing it.

> Maybe we should offer to simply sell the grave back to Holden. We need our wheat, but Holden can take his grave and move it where he wishes. We just need to ship it to him with a lot of bubblewrap and styrofoam to make sure it doesn't get damaged in transit.
> —[[Liam Frog Ashwin]]

On 2023-10-23, [[Remy]], the Glorious Leader of the Remy Republic, announced that he has indeed sold the gravestone, though not back to Holden. He announced that he had auctioned the gravestone off to a group called the [[Tobytopian First Empire Elites]]. Holden did not make any comment in response to this.

Music, upon hearing this news during a committee meeting, immediately began jumping for joy at his podium and yelled to everyone present:

> Finally! Get this grave on the boat immediately!
> GLORIOUS ＧＬＯＲＩＯＵＳ WHEAT!!!!!!
> — Liam Staig Music

On 2023-10-29, the Crazy Straw Grave was taken down and loaded onto the [[RRMS Musician]], a ship newly built for this purpose specifically, captained by one [[Beak Beetroot]], and taken out of the Remy Republic.

The journey was rocky (see [[Beak Beetroot#Shipping the Crazy Straw Grave]]), partially due to Music himself having been in charge of giving Beetroot the directions to the intended destination of the gravestone, and having been slightly imprudent in writing them.

Regardless, Music was finally satisfied.

> Finally got that squared away. More room for wheat.
> —Liam Staig Music

### Deforestation Scheme

On 2023-10-21, the <ruby>Music and the Wheat Committee<rt>This is not a band name.</rt></ruby> published their plan for a major new expansion of the No Wheat Field, on the same order of magnitude as the wheat boom under [[Billzo]]'s rule of the [[Remy Republic]], intending to expand the wheat field by over 2500m².

The plan involved the felling of several hundred oak trees and birch trees from the surrounding, undeveloped, forested land.

> The removal of these trees will allow for a lot of land to be dedicated to new construction. Though the expansion of the wheat field is one major area of focus, the freed up area can also be used for new residential developments in the future. After all, we are going to need farmers to tend to this wheat field at some point.
> —Liam Staig Music, Chairman of the Committee

The Remyan government did not respond to Music's plan. In fact, they never even acknowledged it.

By 2023-10-23, Music had become frustrated and irate with the government's disacknowledgement of his plan, responding by issuing an official temper tantrum, a section of which is quoted as follows:

> We're the most important province; after all, we provide food for the entire country! And "environmental impacts"?? The customers are buying, and the population's multiplying. Who cares if a few trees are dying???

Music's self-aggrandising attitude led to some No residents turning against him.

> He really thinks he's so important, doesn't he?
> 
> Just because the government has given No special attention in the past, I guess. I mean, maybe the parliament has a lot of work to get through, or maybe they are considering the environmental impacts of felling so many trees. This Music guy needs to learn to have some patience.
> 
> There's more to life than just wheat.

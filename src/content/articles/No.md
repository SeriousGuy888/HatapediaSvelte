# History

## Tobytopia Era

The settlement that became No was originally founded by [[Toby]] on the first day of [[HATA]] 1, and given its name of "No" on `2022-12-03` at `00:22` EST.

The first player activity in what is now No was of Toby and Anna being there, duelling and recreationally murdering each other several times. In response to this, """""[[Remy|someone]]""""" placed a sign that said "Toby is a stinky poo" in Tobytopia. This was reportedly because this """""someone""""" thought that [[Toby]] and [[Anna]] were getting too chummy.

### Origins of the Name

This era is also when No got its name — when [[Billzo]] requested that Toby name his land and was met with the answer of "No". Billzo thought this was an awfully strange name for a forest, but thought nothing of it, and labelled this place as No on the first map.

### Alliance with Remy

Soon after selling No, on `2022-12-04` at `15:30`, [[Toby]] announced that he, [[Remy]], [[Remyforg]], and [[Holden]] had just agreed to an alliance.

On `2022-12-17` at `16:29`, Remy announced that Toby had kicked him and Remyforg out of the alliance.

## Remy Republic Era

Toby eventually moved from No to what became [[Tobytown]] in [[Tobytopia]], deciding that he no longer needed to own No.

No subsequently came under the rule of the [[Remy Republic]].

### Toby Sells No to Remy

On `2022-12-04` at `14:09`, it was announced to the public that Toby had officially relinquished ownership of No, having sold it to Remy in exchange for a lifetime membership to Remy's yet to be constructed rollercoaster (what would become the [[Forgsville]] Rollercoaster).

By `18:05` on the same day, Remy had made the decision to convert No into a wheat plantation, having planted some of the first wheat along the saltwater coast. [[Billzo]] also built the [[Fluffy Bridge]] for Remy at the same time.

### Expansion of the Wheat Field

From approximately 2022-12-25 to approximately 2023-01-04, during [[Remy]]'s vacation, [[Billzo]] was placed in charge of the Remy Republic.

While in charge, Billzo convinced [[Remyforg]] to sign a treaty with [[Billzoplace]], namely the [[Treaty of No (2022)]], which gave Billzoplace the rights to import wheat from the Remy Republic, in exchange for Billzoplace expanding the wheat field in No.

During the era of Billzo's rule as provisional glorious leader, the wheat field in No underwent an rapid, explosive expansion. At this time, [[Arvi]] also helped to build the [[Arvi Tower]] and [[Remy's Home Sweet Home]], while Billzo built the [[No Windmill]].

Billzo released a maplapse of the wheat field expansion in the news channel after Remy returned from his vacation.

Some expansion continued even after Remy's return, including some unlikely assistance from [[Anna]].

# History

>[!info] Times in this section are notated in Eastern Standard Time (UTC-5).

## Tobytopia Era

The settlement that became No was originally founded by [[Toby]] on the first day of [[HATA]] 1, and given its name of "No" on `2022-12-03` at `00:22` EST.
 
The first player activity in what is now No was of Toby and Anna being there, duelling and recreationally murdering each other several times. In response to this, """""[[Remy|someone]]""""" placed a sign that said "Toby is a stinky poo" in Tobytopia. This was reportedly because this """""someone""""" thought that [[Toby]] and [[Anna]] were getting too chummy.

This era is also when No got its name — when [[Billzo]] requested that Toby name his land and was met with the answer of "No". Billzo thought this was an awfully strange name for a forest, but thought nothing of it, and labelled this place as No on the first map.

### Toby Sells No to Remy

Toby eventually moved from No to what became [[Tobytown]] in [[Tobytopia]].

On `2022-12-04` at `14:09`, it was announced to the public that Toby had officially relinquished ownership of No, having sold it to Remy in exchange for a lifetime membership to Remy's yet to be constructed rollercoaster (what would become the [[Forgsville]] Rollercoaster).

### Alliance with Remy

Soon after, on `2022-12-04` at `15:30`, [[Toby]] announced that he, [[Remy]], [[Remyforg]], and [[Holden]] had just agreed to an alliance.

On `2022-12-17` at `16:29`, Remy announced that Toby had kicked him and Remyforg out of the alliance.

The Treaty of Neville is a trade and investment agreement signed between the [[Remy Republic]] and [[Neville]].

The treaty was drafted by [[Remy]] and signed by [[Arvi]] after Remy accused Arvi of stealing wheat seeds from [[No]], which Arvi denied. The two then negotiated for Remy to invest in the newly burgeoning Neville wheat fields in exchange for a share of any profits made by Arvi from selling produce from [[Neville]].

The treaty was signed by Arvi and Remy on the same day, 2023-04-07.

# History

Korolarachi was originally founded by [[Arvi]], but he abdicated his position as king of the country on [[UN Meeting 2023-04-02|2023-04-02]], leaving [[bill the Allay]] in charge of the country.

## Pre-Kingdom Era

During the [[HATA 1#HATAwar Era|HATAwar era]], [[Arvi]] and [[Anna]] had decided to join forces. During their time together, Arvi and Anna built two <ruby>sniki<rt>hidden</rt></ruby> bases where they intended to operate out of. The first base was the subject of a long [[Tobytopia|Tobytopian]] search, headed by [[Toby]], who wanted to learn of Arvi's actions and whereabouts. Toby, after enlisting the help of [[Holden]] in this search, attempted at one point to use mathematical methods to locate the base, though their efforts were to little avail due to their limited mathematical prowess.

Once their base was found, Arvi and Anna abandoned the first base, leaving to establish a second base by a lake to the east of Spawn. This base, however, ended up receiving comparatively little development, as Anna soon became inactive on the Minecraft server, and Arvi instead dedicating time to other projects, such as constructing buildings in the Remy Republic such as Remy’s house and the Arvi Tower during Remy's vacation.

Both of these bases were built and used before the Kingdom of Korolarachi was founded, but their existence during HATAwar would set the stage for the birth of Korolarachi during HATAsurv.

## Early Kingdom

### Founding

Seeing that other major players on the server were each heads of their respective countries, Arvi formally established the country of **Korolarachi** in late January of 2023, no later than 2023-01-27.

Though Arvi did not specify exactly what his title would be, outside observers began using the title "King" to refer to him, leading Arvi to eventually acknowledge his own title to be the King of Korolarachi. For this same reason, contemporaneous outside observers often referred to the country as the **Kingdom of Korolarachi**, and modern historians follow suit, though this name is not known to have been used by Arvi himself to refer to the country.

After founding the country, Arvi then decided to claim the first plot of land in the name of his new kingdom. Controversially, he settled on claiming the land around the [[United Nations|HATA UN HQ]]. This caused a slight worry from the [[Remy Republic]], who worried that this meant that Arvi could punish the leaders of other nations had he not gotten his way.

On 2023-01-27, Arvi also designed and released the banner of Korolarchi: ![[Korolarachi Banner.png|Banner of Korolarachi]]

The Kingdom of Korolarachi later officially joined the [[United Nations|HATA United Nations]].

### Expansion

#### Scammington UFO

During his reign as King, Arvi expanded the territory of Korolarachi twice. The first expansion came when Arvi began construction on an large unidentified hovercraft, hovering over the ocean off south coast of [[Scammington]]. As Arvi had decided to build it in secret, the sudden appearance of the UFO in the sky caused fear and panic among the local [[Remy Republic|Remyan]] residents. The Remyan army began firing big damage missiles at the ship to shoot it down, with minimal success. On 2023-02-23, Arvi confirmed to the world that the UFO did in fact belong to Korolarachi, that he built it "for fun", and that it would glow. Arvi would also later allude to plans of constructing a TNT cannon on the UFO pointed straight at the Remyan capital of Hawainot. [[Tobytopia]] offered to help fund Korolarachi in their endeavours, having been in rough straits with the Remy Republic at the time.

The Remy Republic became increasingly anxious of the situation, and they began to formulate a plan in case of Korolarachian attack. No action, however, was taken, as Arvi had soon either decided to abandon the project, leaving the unfinished UFO hanging in the sky. [[Remy]] has repeatedly called it an "eyesore", but many Remyan pleas to Arvi to take down the skeleton of a build, Arvi refused to do so and instead offered to sell the wreck to the Remy Republic, which the Remy Republic declined.

#### Icelands

The second expansion of Korolarachi occurred immediately after the [[Border Disorder]]. Following the Remyan and Tobytopian moves to swiftly claim new territories in the newly unlocked lands, Arvi claimed a territory in the newly available snow biome to the east. The **Korolarachian Icelands** (as they are so called by Remyan mapmakers, as Arvi never named the area), were planned to be the location of a new town, but Arvi never followed through with these plans. The second expansion also marked the territorial peak of the Kingdom of Korolarachi.

## Decline

### The Beginning of the End

During the [[UN Meeting 2023-04-02|UN Meeting on 2023-04-02]], Arvi formally announced that he would abdicate the throne of the Kingdom of Korolarachi in order to pursue other ventures. Some observers from the Remy Republic also believe that Arvi did so partially because "he saw the lack of development in the Kingdom as a failure". When asked by the God of News who would succeed him as King, Arvi named [[bill the Allay]] as the new King of Korolarachi. bill would continue to rule Korolarachi, albeit while spending their days in the HATA UN HQ rather than living in Korolarachian territory itself. Arvi would also remain an advisor to Korolarachi until 2023-04-07, when he stepped down to found the [[Neville|Kingdom of Neville]].

### Remyan Annexation

>[!note] This section is set to be rewritten.

%% Wanting to take advantage of Korolarachi's weakened state, and worried about a potential future return of Arvi, the [[Remy Republic]] launched an invasion of the Korolarchian mainland on the evening of March 16th. King bill was unaware of this invasion as he had been flying around in the HATA UN. Joining the Glorious Leader was Remyan Naval Leader Gary Poutine in his only campaign with the Remyan armed forces. After being met with no resistance, the Remy Republic formally annexed the Korolarachian mainland. The land remained an official Remyan territory for 20 minutes until the Remy Republic renounced its claim to the land, once again making it a territory with no claim. The Glorious Leader explained that this was done because he believed that no nation should control the land around the UN for diplomatic reasons. The Remy Republic then falsely claimed that Korolarachi no longer existed because they had no more land territory. This was believed by the media and bill the allay himself as they both thought the Korolarachi was no more. However, the Glorious Leader was informed a few days later that the Korolarachian Icelands still existed. Not seeing a threat with them, the Remy Republic decided not to annex those lands and they remain the sole part of the Kingdom to this day. %%

## Modern Day

Though continuing to technically exist as a country and member of the HATA UN, Korolarachi has largely been in a state of neglect since Arvi's abdication. Additionally, the Kingdom of Neville, in its rise as a global superpower, has overshadowed Korolarachi. King bill has also since been moved by [[Arvi]] out of the HATA UN HQ to live in [[Layon]].

### Ruler

[[bill the Allay]] continues to rule as King of Korolarachi as of writing (2024-12-30).

# Diplomacy

## International Alliances

After the [[Night of Mischief]], the [[Remy|Glorious Leader]] of the [[Remy Republic]] established the Allies of Asphaleia with the stated goal of "countering the rising chaos created by the nations of Holdentopia, Tobytopia and Neville". After convincing [[Liamland]] to join, Remy had decided to travel to [[Neville]] in order to invite Korolarachi into his alliance. [[bill the Allay|King bill]], with whom Remy was negotiating, told Remy that he was unaware that Korolarachi still existed and that he had never actually set foot in its territory. Remy then left the meeting with bill unwilling to join, and decided to pursue an alliance with [[Che Forguera]] and [[Fortugal]].

In late February 2025, the Remy Republic made a second attempt to court Korolarachi into joining the alliance. This time, bill agreed to join, and Korolarachi is now the third member of the alliance.

## Relationship with Neville

Despite the lack of widely publicised diplomatic interaction, the [[Neville|Kingdom of Neville]] has allowed for [[bill the Allay|King bill]] to live in a house in [[Layon]].

On 2023-06-16, the Kingdom of Neville announced plans to enter the United Nations, with plans to steal the flag of Korolarchi in the process. Worried about copyright infringement, Arvi decided to steal the Pillager flag instead.

## Relationship with Billzoplace

[[Billzo]] (Rather Underwhelming Leader of [[Billzoplace]]), and [[bill the Allay]] (King of Korolarachi) once pointed out each other's countries on a map.

## Relationship with the Remy Republic

The Remy Republic and Korolarchi remain on good terms in the present day.

During the scandal of the Remyan Ice Cream and Cold Treats Union, where the Remy Republic was caught sourcing materials from Holdentopia, union head Jack Forst successfully negotiated a new deal with Korolarachi to get those materials from them instead.

## The United Nations

Korolarchi remains an active member in the United Nations, agreeing and participating on a majority of UN resolutions.

# Name

The name of the country, *Korolarachi*, was decided by Arvi, on the same day as the founding of the kingdom itself, after learning the meaning of the Billzonian word *bakalarachi*. Arvi decided to name his new kingdom similarly, coining the Billzonian word *koro*, meaning "axolotl", and then coining the word *korolarachi* to mimic the word *bakalarachi*.

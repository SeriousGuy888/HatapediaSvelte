**Rest Stop Island** was first discovered and claimed by the [[HATA Piracy Corporation]] on 2023-12-27.

On 2024-05-13, [[Billzo]] started a campaign to develop Rest Stop Island, building a nether portal and linking it to the [[Stone Brick Nether Road Network]] and minorly expanding the island southward, reclaiming around 200mÂ² from the ocean.

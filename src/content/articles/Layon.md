# History

## Chartering of the City of Layon

The City of Layon was officially established on `2023-07-14` by [[Arvi]], the Doomslayer Nine Thousand of the Kingdom of Neville.

Arvi defined the boundaries of the city to effectively be everything that had so far then been built in Neville. This included all structures on the hill — both sides of [[#Archie Bridge]] — but not the area below where a waterfall and further structures were planned.

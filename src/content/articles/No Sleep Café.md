No Sleep Café is a building on the [[Billzoplace]] City north coast.

# History

## Design and Construction

No Sleep Café was first conceptualised in early August when [[Billzo Shoom|Bill]] started drawing up designs for the layout of a future expanded Billzoplace City.

On `2023-08-11`, moderately wonky sketches were produced which contained the city in its current state as well as where buildings might be placed in the future. The sketch page also included an early design for the No Sleep Café (although yet to be so named) from which the building was later designed in Minecraft.

[[Billzo Shoom|Billzo]] spent the following few days in his Minecraft architecture testing world and designing the café itself, which deviated slightly from the sketches. These were then put into a schematic and built on [[HATA]] itself with the help of Litematica.

## Opening

No Sleep Café first opened for business on `2023-08-15`.

### First Comedy Performance

On `2023-08-15`, the day the café opened, a number of people (namely [[Remy]], [[Billzo Shoom|Bill]], [[Hoang]], [[Arvi]], and [[Adam]]) came to the café to attend a comedy performance by Remy.

[[Toby]] felt left out because he could not properly attend on account of being in Winnipeg and having an unreliable internet connection. He logged onto the server but was unable to properly move around due to these connection issues. His [[SlashSpec|spec head]] could be seen in the café, indicating his presence in spirit. Toby ultimately had to have someone screenshare the comedy performance.

Remy, after going AFK on the roof, had his broken mouse accidently right click him onto the head of [[Adam]], causing him to suffocate in the ceiling. After Remy returned, Adam attempted to frame Toby of being responsible for Remy's suffocation death, citing that Toby had logged on, Remy had died, and Toby had then logged off.

Remy told several jokes during this comedy show, which garnered a non-zero amount of laughter from the audience.

# Logo

This is the current official logo of Hata. It was made by [[Billzo Shoom|Bill]] in [Witeboard](https://witeboard.com/) in approximately ten seconds. It is highly epique, and it depicts a green tyrannosaurus, symbolising the tyrannosaurus in [[Holden]]'s awesome adventure.

The logo was officially adopted by [[Toby]], as admin of the server, on `2023-06-20` at `23:58` EDT.

This is a draft of a logo that [[Toby]] made. It was not adopted, because it is not as epique.

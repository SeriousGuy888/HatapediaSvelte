# Toby's Base

Toby lives in [[Tobytopia]].

His base was once secret, but then everyone found it.

# Involvements

## Inheritance Incident

Please see: [[Inheritance Incident]]

## Period of Presumed Death

Leaving on 2023-06-29 and returning on 2023-07-26, Toby left the server to its own devices and decided to go to summer camp or something like that.

### Inheritances

Due to his prolonged absence, Toby was presumed dead by many of the members of HATA. 

People frequently visited his base and took items as part of their inheritance. One notable example of this is how [[Remy]], during the [[Boxing Matchbox War]], snuck off to Tobytopia to acquire a full set of netherite armour in order to combat [[Holden]] and [[Anna]]. The netherite armour was not returned, and, in fact, Remy continued to wear it after the war was over, and was forced to continue using it after he fell into the void while attempting to extend the leaf bridge to Toby's enderender and lost the set of netherite armour gifted to him by [[Arvi]].

### Condemnation by the United Nations

During Toby's presumed death, the [[United Nations]] officially passed their first resolution: *Resolution 1: Regarding Toby's Exodus*, which most notably "*Condemn[ed]* the actions of Toby, the Ultimate Kaiser of Doom Three Thousand of the [[Tobytopia|Tobytopian Empire]], as **baseless**, **cringeworthy**, and **sus**."

This resolution was signed by six separate nations:
- **Billzoplace**, represented by [[Billzo|Bill]]
- **Remy Republic**, represented by [[Remy]]
- **Korolarachi**, represented by [[bill the Allay]]
- **Neville**, represented by [[Anna]]
- **Tobytopia**, represented by [[Holden]]
- **Holdentopia, Incorporated**, represented by [[Holden]]

There was an attempt to mail this resolution to Toby while he was at camp, but Holden failed to provide the address, so this plan failed to come to fruition.

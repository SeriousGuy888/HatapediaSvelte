# About Mangrovepox

Mangrovepox is an infectious disease, known to mainly infect [[Remy Republic|Remyan provinces]].

## Symptoms

- Mangrove trees popping up in your land
- Itchiness

## Transmission

Mangrovepox is transmitted manually. That is to say: [[Holden]] goes around planting mangrovepox, which constitutes spreading it.

# Waves

## Wave 1

The first wave was part of [[Holden]]'s master plan to spread mangrove trees across the entirety of [[HATA]].

## Wave 2

The second wave was [[Holden]]'s act of revenge for [[Remy]]'s usurpation, by justification of the [[Good Neighbour Policy]], of leadership of [[Tobytopia]]. During this time, Remy went to Holden's [[Lilypad Pond]], constructed a capital building, and renamed the area to [[Propagule Palace]].

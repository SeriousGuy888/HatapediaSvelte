The Mushroom War was a brief war between the [[Remy Republic]] and the [[Neville|City of Neville]] *(this was before Neville changed its official name to the Kingdom of Neville)*. [[Holdentopia, Incorporated]] also took part in the war as part of a coalition with Neville during the [[#Raid on No]]. The war took place from approximately `2023-07-08` at `22:25` to approximately `00:48` the next day.

# Background

[[Auze]] is a territory of the Remy Republic — a mushroom island — [claimed](https://discord.com/channels/1046302463143194709/1048416479093198908/1116973796545544203) by the [[Remy|Glorious Leader]] on `2023-06-10` during his adventure to see the wizard, specifically the Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

# Nevillian Invasion of Auze

On `2023-07-08`, [[Arvi]], the Doomslayer Nine Thousand of the City of Neville, was exploring the ocean east of (what is now known as) [[Layon]] and, receiving word from [[Billzo Shoom|Bill]] that he was near Auze, decided to make a visit to the island.

## Nevillian Landing

Arvi crafted an oak boat and, with his newly assembled navy, sailed south-southeast towards the island. Making landfall on the north side of Auze at approximately `22:25`, Arvi was reportedly enthralled by the scenery and wonderstruck by the mushrooms and mooshrooms.

> Oh, [[Anna]] wanted some mushrooms.
> 
> ―[[Arvi]], after landing on Auze

Arvi's invasion of the island was largely uncontested by the local Remyan garrison of zero troops, and the Nevillian forces were able to swiftly secure military control of the island within minutes.

Arvi, at approximately `22:30` climbed to the tallest hill on Auze, where stood the banner of the Remy Republic first planted by Remy a month ago. He broke the banner and replaced it with the banner of Neville.

## War Crimes

The invasion was not *entirely* painless however. Arvi reportedly used his fire aspect netherite sword to slay an unarmed civilian — a mooshroom — reducing it to cooked steak and leather instantly. Arvi also crafted wooden bowls and milked several other mooshrooms on the island for mushroom stew.

The murdered mooshroom's family as well as several of the milked mooshrooms have since accused the invading Nevillian forces of war crimes, calling for their prosecution, but nothing has since come of this.

## Casualties for the Auze Campaign

|                   | City of Neville |       Remy Republic       |
| -----------------:|:---------------:|:-------------------------:|
|          Military |        0        |             0             |
|   Civilian Deaths |                 |             1             |
| Civilian Injuries |                 | ≥3 milked without consent |

## Remyan Reactions

Finally coming online on Discord, [[Remy]] discovered the news about the Nevillian and headed directly to [[Hawainot]] to meet with his top general, [[Fletcher Quadratic]] in order to discuss plans to retake the island. The plan they came up with was called [[Operation Yellow Brick Road]].

The operation did not end up going ahead as the conflict had been resolved before it could be executed, although Remy did, at multiple occasions, consider ordering the operation to begin.

# Remyan Occupation of Archie Bridge

Deciding to retalliate, at approximately `22:45`, the [[Remy|Glorious Leader]] gathered supplies from his [[Remy's Home Sweet Home|Home Sweet Home]] and stepped into the nether portal in the [[Wheat Sacrifice Shrine]].

## Invasion

Stepping out of the nether portal in [[Layon]] (then known as the *City of Neville*), Remy walked around Neville, seeing the sights and taking selfies. He then made his way to [[Layon#Archie Bridge|Archie Bridge]] and placed Remyan banners on both entrances on either side of the bridge.

![[Remy arrives in Neville 2023-07-08.png]]

## Remy's Demands

He also placed signs outside the west entrance to the bridge, listing his demands to Arvi, among which was the return of Auze. The full content of the signs with the demands were as follows (corrections and emphasis mine):

> Arvi, my demands are clear[:] **return my mushroom island back to me**[.] If you fail to do so, the Archie [B]ridge will remain Remyan land[.] This is my peaceful way of solving this mistake of yours[.] Do not increase tensions further[.]
> 
> [S]igned[,]
> RemyHemy
> The Glorious Leader
> 
> PS[:] If Anna needs mushrooms, she should look in a dark oak fo[r]est. OR START A MUSHROOM FARM!

## Annexation

At approximately `22:50`, after listing his demands, the Glorious Leader then climbed atop Archie bridge and announced its annexation into the Remy Republic, proclaiming its incorporation as a new administrative territory.

> I, the Glorious Leader of the Remy Republic, proclaim this bridge to be the newest territory of the Remy Republic: the *Territory of Archie*.

## Casualties for the Remyan Invasion of Archie Bridge

No casualties are known to have occurred, save for an allegedly [[Tobytopia|Tobytopian]] creeper.

# Raid on No

Arvi did not fold to Remy's demands, instead resolving to form a coalition with [[Holden]], bringing him and [[Anna]] along to do *something* at [[No]]. It is unclear exactly what their exact intentions were, as their plans were derailed immediately when they arrived in No by a pillager raid.

## Triggering of the Raid

At approximately `00:15` on `2023-07-09`, [[Arvi]], [[Anna]], and [[Holden]], together forming a *Triple Trouble Tower* (they were sitting on each other's heads) arrived in [[No]] via the nether portal in the [[Wheat Sacrifice Shrine]]. Although it was not their original intention, their arrival immediately triggered a pillager raid on No as Anna was unintentionally carrying the Bad Omen status effect.

The [[Remy|Glorious Leader]] was notified of this raid by the [[Billzo Shoom|God of News]] as the Triple Trouble Tower was crossing Fluffy Bridge. Upon noticing the raid bossbar, he was reportedly very unhappy with the actions of <ruby>Holden and the Nevillians<rt>This is not a band name.</rt></ruby>.

![[Raid triggered on No 2023-07-09.png]]

## Remy's Defence Efforts

After a minor altercation with the trio, the Glorious Leader charged across [[Fluffy Bridge]], intending to gloriously defend No from the raiding pillagers.

However, the Glorious Leader was unfortunately unable to prevent the two villagers from being shot dead by the pillagers: [[Liam Forg Ashwin]] and [[Billzo Caterpillar]]. Remy would later revive them in a séance due to the privileges afforded to two villagers by their plot armour.

## Defence Efforts of Holden and the Nevillians

Arvi, Anna, and Holden also aided in the efforts to defend No from the raiders as the raid was not their intention. The Glorious Leader repeatedly insisted that they leave, insisting that he could handle the raid by himself, but Arvi assured Remy that he, in fact, could *not* handle it. The trio also occasionally fired some arrows at Remy.

The pillagers brought in witches and <ruby>armoured vehicles<rt>ravagers</rt></ruby>, destroying wheat and leaves around the southern side of No. Arvi attempted to mitigate this damage by encouraging everyone, including Remy, to lead the ravagers into the water and not into the wheat field, but damage was already done by the time everyone listened.

## Other Defence Efforts

Bill, the God of News also arrived, firing arrows and [[big damage missile|rockets]] into the fray.

## End of the Raid

The raid continued until around `00:25`. Billzo trapped two pillagers in a boat outside the shrine, which Remy promised to torture comprehensively, but Holden stabbed them before Remy could do so.

## Casualties for the Raid on No

There were at least seven waves of raiders as the server was set to Hard mode ([Minecraft wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Raid#Raid_wave_composition)).

|          | [[Remy Republic]] | [[Holdentopia, Incorporated]] | [[Neville\|City of Neville]] |    Pillagers     |
| --------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:----------------:|
| Military |         0         |         6x [[Holden]]         |         1x [[Arvi]]          | 51 to 83 raiders |
| Civilian |    2x Villager    |                               |                              |                  |

# Resolution

## Revival Séance

After the Raid on No was over, Remy took the <ruby>corpses<rt>villagermeat</rt></ruby> of [[Liam Forg Ashwin]] and [[Billzo Caterpillar]] to the Wheat Sacrifice Shrine and placed them atop the sacred revival flame. Uttering the required incantations to invoke their plot armour, the two villagers were brought back from the dead.

Liam Forg Ashwin had come back with a <ruby>new set of drip<rt>cold biome villager clothing</rt></ruby> that he purchased during his time in the underworld, but Billzo Caterpillar was still wearing the same old plains villager clothes he had died in.

The two villagers then returned to their composters, put their straw hats on again, and got to replanting the wheat damaged in the raid.

## Flexagon's Firework Show

To celebrate the victory over the raiders, [[Gerry Flexagon]], who was standing in the chicken pen, started setting off fireworks. [[Harry Toothbrush]] watched this firework show, but was not entirely paying attention, as he was simultaneously watching *Tom and Jerry* by the ruins of [[Arvi Tower]].

## Arvi and Anna's Apology

At `00:48`, Arvi and Anna then had Bill mail some items to Remy as an apology for the raid.

![[Arvi and Anna's apology gift to Remy 2023-07-09.png]]

They attached the following message to their apology:

> we are sorry
> 
> kiss face
> 
> 😊
> 
> gamemode creative/
> 
> hm

## Who Won?

The Mushroom War's resolution was one of *[status quo ante bellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_ante_bellum)*. Everything returned to the state it was in at the start of the war. Arvi claims the whole war was just a joke blown out of proportion, while Remy has expressed annoyance at constantly being disturbed by other nations.

After the war, Arvi and Remy made a verbal agreement to return all captured territories. Remy would later remove his banners from [[Layon#Archie Bridge]] and replaced the Nevillian banner on [[Auze]] once more with the Remyan banner.

No formal treaty was ever signed; the verbal agreement is the only agreement made.

## Pink and Purple Treaty

A few days later, on `2023-07-13`, Arvi and Remy signed the [[Pink and Purple Treaty]], constituting a formal alliance between the [[Remy Republic]] and the, then newly renamed, [[Neville|Kingdom of Neville]].

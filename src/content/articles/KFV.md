Toby also attempted to do an armed robbery after this photo was taken, but was successful gaslighted by Billzo into thinking that it doesn't make sense to do so because he owns this KFV.

## Remy Republic

There were plans to build a branch of KFV in the [[Remy Republic]], although with a slightly modified menu and <ruby>different<rt>green</rt></ruby> branding. One of the proposed names for this Remy Republic branch of KFV was to be Kale and Fried Veggis.

These plans have not come to fruition as of writing (2024-05-31).

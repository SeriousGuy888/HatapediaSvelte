# Background

## Tobytopian Incursions upon Forg Populations

During the [[HATA 1#HATAwar Era|HATAwar era of HATA1]], [[Toby]] wanted [[Tobytopia]] to have some bases in the [[Swamp of Secrets]] in more defensible locations — locations that would be easy for Toby or his allies to find with some practice, but which would be difficult to find or invade by outside forces. Tobytopia's movements in the Swamp of Secrets disturbed some local frog populations, who felt that Tobytopia was infringing upon their autonomy.

## Formation of a Fortuguese National Identity During the Great Mangrove War

The forgs' anger seemingly increased during the [[Great Mangrove War]] between Tobytopia and the [[Remy Republic]]. Many historians believe that Remyan agitators played a big role in rallying the forgs into a state of rebellion. By 2023-01-20, some forgs had begun to use the demonym "Fortuguese" to refer to themselves, and a map (though its veracity is greatly doubted) was leaked to the press, supposedly depicting Fortuguese plans to take over and reorganise Tobytopia.

On the day of the [[Great Mangrove War#Final Confrontation|final battle of the Great Mangrove War]], 2023-01-22, [[Holden]], on behalf of Tobytopia, tried to burn down [[Remy's Home Sweet Home|Remy's house]] and the Remy Republic's [[Fluffy Bridge]], which led to the Remy Republic's army, led by [[Remy]], getting on a boat and burning down a considerable portion of the Swamp of Secrets.

This stoked the ire of the Fortuguese populace towards the Remy Republic, but Remyan historians say that due to the Remy Republic's immediate donations of money and mangrove propagules to repair some of the damage, as well as the Remy Republic being at odds with Tobytopia at the time, the forgs saw that they and the Remyans had a common rival in Tobytopia.

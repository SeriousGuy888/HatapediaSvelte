# Background

## Tobytopian Incursions upon Forg Populations

During the [[HATA 1#HATAwar Era|HATAwar era of HATA1]], [[Toby]] wanted [[Tobytopia]] to have some bases in the [[Swamp of Secrets]] in more defensible locations — locations that would be easy for Toby or his allies to find with some practice, but which would be difficult to find or invade by outside forces. Tobytopia's movements in the Swamp of Secrets disturbed some local frog populations, who felt that Tobytopia was infringing upon their autonomy.

## Formation of a Fortuguese National Identity During the Great Mangrove War

The forgs' anger seemingly increased during the [[Great Mangrove War]] between Tobytopia and the [[Remy Republic]]. Many historians believe that Remyan agitators played a big role in rallying the forgs into a state of rebellion. By 2023-01-20, some forgs had begun to use the demonym "Fortuguese" to refer to themselves, and a map (though its veracity is greatly doubted) was leaked to the press, supposedly depicting Fortuguese plans to take over and reorganise Tobytopia.

On the day of the [[Great Mangrove War#Final Confrontation|final battle of the Great Mangrove War]], 2023-01-22, [[Holden]], on behalf of Tobytopia, tried to burn down [[Remy's Home Sweet Home|Remy's house]] and the Remy Republic's [[Fluffy Bridge]], which led to the Remy Republic's army, led by [[Remy]], getting on a boat and burning down a considerable portion of the Swamp of Secrets.

Remyan historians say that although this incident briefly stoked the ire of the Fortuguese populace towards the Remy Republic, due to the Remy Republic's immediate donations of money and mangrove propagules to repair some of the damage, as well as the Remy Republic being at odds with Tobytopia at the time, the forgs saw that they and the Remyans had a common rival in Tobytopia.

## Remyan Support

Following the [[Night of Mischief]], Remy on 2023-04-10, announced the creation of an alliance called the Allies of Asphaleia and began attempting to recruit countries to their cause. On 2023-04-29, Remy travelled into the Swamp of Secrets, having arranged ahead of time to meet with General [[Che Forguera]] of the Fortuguese Resistance Fighters. Remy was surprised that when he arrived at the Fortuguese camp, there was no trace of violent conflict at all. The Fortuguese fighters seemed either to have been entirely ignored or simply not yet located by the Tobytopian forces. Remy commented that he found Forguera to be rather personable and genuine, rather than simply a ruthless warlord.

At this meeting, Remy offered "assistance" (though the exact nature of this assistance is unclear) to Che Forguera's army, and Forguera graciously accepted this offer. After returning to the Remy Republic, Remy presented this proposal of aiding the Fortuguese fighters to the Remyan Parliament. On 2023-05-03, the public received word that the Remyan Parliament had approved further negotiations with and the provision of <ruby>forguitarian<rt>/ˌfɔɹ.gɪˈtɛ.ri.ən/</rt></ruby> aid to the Fortuguese Resistance.

> **Remyan Parliament to Approve Negotiations with Che Forguera**
> After the Glorious Leader's meeting with General Che Forguera of the Fortuguese Resistance, the Remyan Parliament has approved the Glorious Leader's intent to negotiate providing forguitarian aid to the Fortuguese Resistance against the Tobytopian Government. Further details about these planned negotiations are not yet known.
>
> These parliamentary discussions were held in a Zoom meeting online, where there were reportedly no technical difficulties in an act of never before seen technical competence in the Villager Council.
>
> In related news, the Glorious Leader reportedly recently left for his vacation in Floridanot, and has been there while the parliament conducted this session. The Glorious Leader has refused to comment on what mode of transportation he used to get to Floridanot ― airplane, boat, train, horse, or pig.

On 2023-06-08, the Remy Republic also accused Tobytopia of persecuting followers of the Fortuguese religion.

## Tobytopian Attacks

On 2023-06-04, [[Toby]], the Ultimate Kaiser of Doom Three Thousand of Tobytopia, seemingly unhappy about the Fortuguese rebellion, stated that Che Forguera may soon "die of natural causes".

### Capture of Forguera and and Castcroak

On 2023-06-08, [[Remy]] was on his way to visit Che Forguera in a secret Fortuguese base located in a clearing in the Swamp of Secrets, but when he arrived, he noticed and notified the public that Che Forguera was missing, and that Forguera appeared to have been "dragged away with a struggle". Tobytopian authorities acknowledged this to be the case, but assured that Forguera was safe and sound, and was being held in a roomy cell of eight cubic meters. The Tobytopian army soon discovered Remy at the intended meeting location and began firing [[big damage missile|big damage missiles]] at the safehouse, while Remy hid inside along with [[Forgdel Castcroak]], Forguera's successor.

Remy managed to flee the encounter with only minor missilescathing, but Castcroak was captured by the Tobytopian authorities, taken away and imprisoned in Toby's cave under the [[DVD Player]].

On 2023-06-20, Tobytopia released photos showing that Castcroak was being well-fed despite his incarceration.

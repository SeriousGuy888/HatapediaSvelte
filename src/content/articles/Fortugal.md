<ruby>Fortugal<rt>/ˈfɔɹ.t͡ʃə.gəl/</rt></ruby> is a currently unrecognised <ruby>Forguik<rt>/ˈfɔɹ.gɪk/</rt></ruby> state, in a state of rebellion against [[Tobytopia]].

# Origins

## Background

During the [[HATA 1#HATAwar Era|HATAwar era of HATA1]], [[Toby]] wanted [[Tobytopia]] to have some bases in the [[Swamp of Secrets]] in more defensible locations — locations that would be easy for Toby or his allies to find with some practice, but which would be difficult to find or invade by outside forces. Tobytopia's movements in the Swamp of Secrets disturbed some local frog populations, who felt that Tobytopia was infringing upon their autonomy.

In the leadup to the [[Great Mangrove War]], Holden, on behalf of Tobytopia, burned down [[Remy]]'s house and attempted to burn down the [[Remy Republic]]'s [[Fluffy Bridge]], which led to the Remy Republic's army, led by [[Remy]], getting on a boat and burning down a considerable portion of the Swamp of Secrets.

This stoked the ire of the Fortuguese populace towards the Remy Republic, but due to the Remy Republic's immediate donations of money and mangrove propagules to repair some of the damage<sup>[citation needed]</sup>, as well as the Remy Republic being at odds with Tobytopia at the time, the forgs saw that they and the Remyans had a common rival in Tobytopia.
